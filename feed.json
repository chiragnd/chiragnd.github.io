It might also be the result of a court order that has nothing to do with censorship — but at this point, there’s no way to know for certain.</blockquote>\n<p>Good thing he gave himself an out considering couldn’t resist throwing around a grand total of one speculation — about Aadhaar. As Medianama — the site he references — points out <a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2017/08/223-internet-archive-blocked-court-orders-obtained-bollywood-studios/\" target=\"_blank\">in a separate piece</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>The orders came following cases filed by Red Chillies Entertainment and Prakash Jha Productions, who filed motions for the block to protect their films, “Jab Harry Met Sejal” and “Lipstick Under My Burkha” respectively. 2,650 URLs were blocked as a part of the order: the exact same list of sites was used by the both the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p>What is impressive is that Medianama updated the original piece with 2 different updates to include comments from the Internet Archive, but chose not to add an Update 3, or linking to its separate piece on the actual reasons and the Court orders.</p>\n<p>For those curious about what happened, the Court order seems to be in effect for a period of one week.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Some comments on <a href=\"http://www.vijayvaani.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?aid=4271\" target=\"_blank\">Aadhaar or Adhar</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Firstly unlike a password, biometric data is not secret and also not in full control of the owner of biometrics. Biometric data today are shared not only with Aadhaar authorities but practically everywhere, including attendance systems and banks. Even on table and doors accessed by that individual.</blockquote>\n<p>The same problem (and more) exists with passwords. How do you stop someone from using the same one everywhere (and therefore being hacked somewhere else and then his Govt ID being abused?). From writing it down and sticking it in a drawer or on a computer screen? When it is so easy to reverse engineer, imagine tying critical services to a unique ID with a password? Even companies are moving away from just passwords (or in some cases passwords altogether). So I would argue that a password is not secret at all, and easily transferable and reverse engineered.</p>\n<p>So then the question is, is biometrics more reliable and secure? <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/a-few-biometric-concerns-8a1013b36cd7\" target=\"_blank\">The answer would seem to be yes</a>.</p>\n<p>The video has been taken down so I have no way of verifying it. But considering Google/Apple continue to use fingerprints and every notice so far of copying fingerprint is anecdotal, and that Aadhaar’s CIDR is not using just 3 points of fingerprint matching.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial support to non-citizens</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Section 9 clarifies that Aadhaar is not the proof of Citizenship or Domicile. This means that benefits accruing out of Aadhaar will be <em>niraadhaar</em> (without basis of Citizenship). It is very strongly recommended that a special mark must be indicative in Aadhaar number itself (like * mark) to show that the person is NOT a citizen of India. The government has passed repeated orders to identify Indian Citizens but there appears to be no progress in this regard. In any case, the requesting entity must know if the person being enquired on is Indian or not.</blockquote>\n<p>I think this isn’t the right line of reasoning. Aadhaar isn’t a proof of citizenship (it is a form of identification/authentication), and therefore Aadhaar is not the basis of a subsidy either. Aadhaar is needed to <em>avail</em> the subsidy, not qualify for it.</p>\n<p>For example, a certain maximum balances qualifies a JanDhan account, or a certain income level qualifies you for an LPG subsidy. UID then helps ensure that the subsidy is passed on to the qualified person correctly (and alternatively you have the guarantee the bank account was opened in your name correctly). Aadhaar doesn’t help you qualify for EPFO, it ensures you get your EPFO in your bank account, etc.</p>\n<p>Point is, the qualification of a subsidy has not changed, and aadhar is not being used as a basis of that determination.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Risk</strong></p>\n<blockquote>According to section 11(2), the authority will be a body corporate, which means it will be covered under section 43(A) of the Information Technology Act and rules made thereunder. It also means that the authority will not have protection provided to the government in case of any failure. If for any reasons, any core biometric information is lost, then the authority will be liable for civil liability of unlimited amount. Unlike the other methods of authentication, biometric loss is lifelong loss, hence the liabilities of such loss will be far enhanced. In a case of complete loss, the civil liability may be few lakh crores. Is the authority or the government ready for such loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Will the government be morally right to pay for such loss to the citizens of India from the money collected through taxes from citizens of India, for its own incompetence? The Act is silent on this risk assessment.</blockquote>\n<p>Fair point. This will also need to be separated against breach (of even rules, not necessarily of data) that may occur within the ecosystem vs by the UIDAI.</p>\n<blockquote>Secondly, Biometrics are permanent; unlike a password or a smart card, they cannot be changed. God forbid, if the complete Aadhaar database is compromised (like that of Sony) and which must be expected to be so, the biometrics of all citizens will be compromised. Isn’t it far too big a risk for the government to take? Access to sensitive areas such as defence installations, which use biometrics as access control, will automatically become unusable for life of that senior defence officer. There is no way to correct the situation, unlike password and token.</blockquote>\n<p>There are numerous things that need to be done — this is what I stressed on during our Twitter chat — to ensure the system is secure. Everything from encryption methods, process certifications, splitting the DB into pieces so access to a single database does not compromise us in entirely are being done.</p>\n<p>Numerous governments collect biometrics from their residents and also their visitors. Do we have any cases of them being leaked and then misused? There is an inherent security by purpose that requires Governments to do everything in their power to ensure the security of this database. Having reviewed within my limited expertise the <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72\" target=\"_blank\">access to CIDR bits</a>, i.e., over the API, I am assured that it is not going to be easy to pull data out.</p>\n<blockquote>The challenges in this field will increase manifold as financial transactions based on biometrics increase. For example, the government had ordered that App Praman is used for giving life certificate for all pensioners. An individual can create his artificial fingerprint and give to his own family to continue to draw full pension even after his death.</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but once the death is registered and the Aadhaar is then locked, what good is the fake fingerprint? And they wouldn’t be able to register a new person with the fake fingerprint either once the person is logged in. So it becomes a closed door.</p>\n<blockquote>Section 14 does not limit the citizenry of chairperson and the members of the authority, hence it is possible to appoint a chairman who is neither Indian nor resident of India. It is, therefore, necessary to make appropriate amendments in section 14 which should state that the chairperson and members should be ‘resident Indian citizens’ only. If we cannot get a reasonably competent person to be chairperson or member of the authority then it is a matter of shame. Additionally, if such persons are foreign nationals then ensuring compliance of Section 16 will be impossible.</blockquote>\n<p>Agree, there does not seem to be any limitation of citizenship on the authority, except indirectly and only on certain positions. I agree this should be explicit.</p>\n<p>To your other point, you’re right as well, the Act does not quantify what violation of breach of UIDAI members would be (in case of the cool off period for instance). So a) I hope that is correct but b) it must be remembered that the law prohibits a cooling off period, meaning that a Court can then apply a reasonable punishment despite a lack of definition.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationship with Software, Hardware and Database Vendors</strong></p>\n<blockquote>There has been repeated questioning of the UPA government in respect of the contract it has signed with various software and hardware providers and database maintainers, especially the contractual agreement between the Authority and MongoDB. Neither the UPA government nor the NDA government issued any clarification in this regard.</blockquote>\n<p>The issue I have the constant mention of MongoDB is that there is no mention of this anywhere. To some extent, the level of agreement and other specific details of the infrastructure should be limited (and clearly is). What has been made clear is that multiple technologies are in use (for example 3 open source softwares are in use for deduplication) with a focus on open source to eliminate proprietary restrictions or lack of support.</p>\n<blockquote>If the silence is considered as acceptance of this contractual flaw, then section 22B has extended this contractual liability forever and shared the private sensitive data of Indian citizens and residents with the US government. The charges are serious and silence is not an answer.</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t believe silence makes something accepted or contractual. Do we have a right to know — thereby giving someone with malintentions the right to know — this we can debate. While I have heard the MongoDB arguments multiple times, I’m yet to see anything verified that use of MongoDB automatically hands anything to the US Government, but the problem with something ambigious is both sides can keep fighting without something verifiable. That said, if Aadhaar is disconnected from the open world (as it is listed to be), connectible only via verified vendors and through specified APIs, this would still severely limit any one’s access to data.</p>\n<p>But the point you make here starts with an assumption, and if that assumption is wrong, then the rest does not flow. There has been no indication that technical safeguards are not in place — things like separating storage of different pieces of data across independent DBs, encryption models — which are in fact in place.</p>\n<blockquote>Section 23(2)(c)empowers the Authority to appoint an entity for operation of Central Identity Database Repository (CIDR). However, no limitation has been put in this regard that Indians’ core sensitive data will not be handed over to a foreign entity. There is a precedence of such misuse, which has serious national security impact.</blockquote>\n<p>Actually the law is quite clear re: core sensitive data, coming from Section 29 (1)(a), that it cannot be shared ‘with anyone for any reason whatsoever,’ other than for ‘national security’, which in turn, has to be verified by an Oversight Committee, followed by a Court order.</p>\n<p><strong>Attempt to Risk Transfer</strong></p>\n<blockquote>The risk in case of leakage of personal sensitive data of ALL Indian citizens is enormously high and irreparable. Once biometrics are lost they are lost forever, no change is possible. Through Section 28 (4)(c ), the Act has made a weak attempt to transfer such risks to the consultants and advisers which is neither practical nor possible to meet the civil liabilities in case of loss of any core biometric information. In case the decision to implement any advice is that of the Authority then the liability also must rest with the Authority. Only limited liability up to the fee so paid can be charged from Advisers and consultants. No court will support such open-ended provision.</blockquote>\n<p>With over 400 crore auth transactions and no clear stealing of data having been done, this is an assumption. Yes the risk is high and hence the safeguards are also high.</p>\n<p>Where does the Act limit liability of violation? In fact, due to Section 29 (1), sharing core biometric data is a serious violation of law, even if punishment has not been specified.</p>\n<p>Second, Section 28(4)(c ) actually imposes requirement on the UIDAI to ensure that agreements are entered into are correct and compliant with the Act. The Act says that core biometric data cannot be shared with anyone. Therefore any agreement that allows this sharing is a continued violation of this law, as well as any provisions under IPC/IT Act. See the immediate next Section 28(5) that no one in the Authority can reveal information inside the CIDR to “anyone”.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligence Gathering</strong></p>\n<blockquote>The Bill at Section 13(3) allows the intelligence agencies to dip into the core biometric information and even extract it for an individual or group</blockquote>\n<p>No idea what this is. There is no section 13(3) and no, no intelligence agency has any provision within the Act to “dip into the core biometric information”.</p>\n<p>In fact, in 2014, the CBI wanted Aadhaar biometric details of an individual, which the High Court ordered. The UIDAI filed a response in the Supreme Court, to which the <a href=\"http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/2524201422432014p.txt\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court ordered</a>, and I quote:</p>\n<blockquote>“In the meanwhile, the present petitioner is restrained from transferring any biometric information of any person who has been allotted the Aadhaar number to any other agency without his consent in writing.”</blockquote>\n<p>The UIDAI’s request was upheld and the Court ruled that even transfer of information to investigative agencies had to be done with ‘consent’ of the holder.</p>\n<blockquote>Additionally, the Act is silent on security and privacy of the databases collected by Intelligence Agencies over a period of time, interacting with CIDR. And with this single mechanism, Gestapo or Nazi type operations can be easily launched. Unlike many advanced countries, India does not have an Intelligence Services Act to fix accountability. Hence this can lead to serious breach to freedom of citizens. (I have personally suffered such abuse by Intelligence Agencies).</blockquote>\n<p>I feel you are referencing the Bill 2010 perhaps. The 2016 Act is *not* silent on security or privacy of interacting with the CIDR, and the Regulations further define this. While i’m sorry you have sufferenced abuse by Intelligence Agencies, this does not flow from the law.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I understand you’re targeting the implications of breach. But the question is always in the process — is the law solid, and then if so, is it being implimented/adjudicated correctly. So my argument is that the law actually entails enough provisions to help protect everywhere and illegitimize items like you mention in terms of interacting with CIDR.</p>\n<p><strong>Target of Cyber warfare</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Central Identity Data Repository (CIDR) will be a valid and lucrative target for cyber war. Operation PRISM, Vault 7 and many other leakages of information of NSA (USA) have clearly established that the agenda of United States is to have cyber supremacy over the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[…] It may be noted that the RSA designed algorithm has inbuilt security loophole for the US Government to hack into any system / individual using it. Therefore unless such algorithm, including its random seed generator are written, vetted and certified in India, it will be serious cyber war-related security threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>India has the capacity to write such codes and vet + Certify them, but it is not clear if the source code of these algorithms have been written in India and vetted by a different Indian authority or not. In case these are provisioned directly from where the software and database have been procured, then it must be assumed that CIDR stands already compromised, and US government already has Aadhaar CIDR data.</blockquote>\n<p>Again we’re starting with an assumption, which if incorrect crumbles the entire argument. What is however clear from various technical documents published by the UIDAI, the CIDR does not run on a single piece of software and therefore even if we were to concede that a piece of software came direct and the US government has some way to break that (remember that just hackable software isn’t enough, you need to be able to reach the servers running *that* piece of software to do something with it, but fine), even then it does not automatically flow that the US Government has Aadhaar data.</p>\n<p>RSA is not the *only* encryption algorithm in play. In the layer where it is involved, it is combined with ECB. The other encryption layer uses AES/SHA-256. <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72\" target=\"_blank\">I have already highlighted</a> how well each of these algorithms are rated, and cite a report by the European Network of Excellent in Cryptology. I will make the assumption here that they would not be going around recommending encryption that is loopholed by the US Govt.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Punishment with Complex Procedures</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Chapter VII of the Act shows that the Government is NOT serious to punish anyone in case of any breach. On one hand, the Act agrees that it is collecting personal sensitive data of all residents of India, but on the other hand, there is no offence mentioned which has punishment more than three years of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p>The argument is subjective, but as we debated on Twitter, offences can be compounded with IPC or the IT Act, which carry their own terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Just logically, the Act has made establishes what is legal. A Court’s interpretation therefore would be that failure to correctly collect data or misuse of data would be, by definition illegal. In the event that the Law does not specify punishment, the Court can fill the gaps. With respect to the offences listed there — such as the case where an agency revealed someone’s Aadhaar number even if inadvertantly — the UIDAI is the fine that has to file the case. The expectation then is that the citizen’s right to grievance redressal (guaranteed under Law as well), will then be furthered by the UIDAI in the event of violation. However, I contend that should the UIDAI fail in guaranteeing the person’s right to grievance redressal, you have a right to ask the Court to intervene, by virtual of it being illegal under the Act itself.</p>\n<blockquote>The world is well aware of the case of Edward Snowden stealing this type of information from the National Security Agency of USA. In case of similar act by any employee of the authority, the maximum punishment is just ONE year imprisonment with fine of Rs. 25,000/-.</blockquote>\n<p>Edward Snowden stole biometric data? Or confidential documents?</p>\n<blockquote>Does the Government intend that if an employee of CIDR who has authorised access takes unauthorised copies from CIDR, he is not a serious offender? On similar lines, if the chairperson and/or members compromise anything related to Aadhaar, no action can be taken against them unless the same authority complaints against itself [refer section 47(1)]. Even Government has no power to make complaint for any such criminal liability.</blockquote>\n<p>The law does not guarantee this authorized access, and legally it is clear that it makes him a serious offender, albeit without a specific sentence.</p>\n<blockquote>The Government has cut its own hands; it cannot even issue directions related to technical or administrative matters (submitting complaint for an offence is an administrative action and not a policy issue) as the Aadhaar authority becomes ultimate authority in such matters under proviso of Section 50(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thus we have a situation where ONLY on the ‘complaint’ of the Aadhaar Authority a criminal proceeding can be initiated; Police investigation is NOT necessary; such offences despite being of low punishment value can be tried ONLY in CMM or Session Court; but no court can give punishment more than three years of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p>If the Central government would have given itself superceeding powers, wouldn’t the argument have been that ultimately you want an independent entity managing this and not misuse by political pressure? This is the reason for these provisions and in fact, makes sense. But also note Section 50(2): “The decision of the Central Government, whether a question is one of policy or not, shall be final.” We can’t have a discussing about wanting foreign Govts out of the security loopholes that may exist but also want the Central Govt to have powers to use technical shortcomings right? You want the politicos out of the administrative matters — pertaining to maintaining, running operations, etc as well.</p>\n<p>The problem again is that of isolation, one rule does not negate the other. Firstly, the police wouldn’t be involved anyway. Second, it must be remembered that everything pertaining to the CIDR and its definition comes from the IT Act (the CIDR is a protected system under Section 70 making it punishable with a 10 year term) and a CII under NCIIPC making even the attempt to break into it an Act of cyber terrorism.</p>\n<p>I want to finally comment on this line:</p>\n<blockquote>It appears that the present Government has picked up the pathetically drafted Aadhaar Bill prepared by UPA Government, dusted, rehashed it at a few places[…]</blockquote>\n<p>How? The sheer number of differences between the two bills is monumental (<a href=\"http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/aadhaar-bill-2016-niai-bill-2010-text-comparison\" target=\"_blank\">see this</a>), not to mention that the Bill did not even have a definition for core biometric data, let alone its protection. This, in and of itself, cannot be considered “rehashed in a few places”, sorry.</p>\n<p>The fundamental issue—compounded in India due to our sheer numbers—is how do we ensure service delivery without identification. Aadhaar attempts to solve this bottom line. Without the Act though, Aadhaar was horrendously problematic and I believe the Act takes care of numerous issues that would have severely hindered both adoption and utilization. Unlike other government IDs like a passport, it will be harder to fake—you can still create a fake number for example, but when a services require you to authenticate, each auth will be verified making it that much harder to game the system, which is why I like it better.</p>\n<p>Some of the issues you raise such as where things say ‘will be explained by Regulation’ actually are explained in Regulation (there are 5 Regulations simultaneously introduced that specify other elements). My problem arise at assumptions that something is just flawed, or worse, We’d be fools to think there isn’t scope for improvement in the law so I say let’s continue to suggest those.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Numerous pieces have been surfacing over the last few days discussing the impacts of the Government’s <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/new-rules-under-prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals-act-notified-3980f4802d1?source=linkShare-7570374edbfe-1495963574\" target=\"_blank\">new Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Rules</a>, notified on May 23.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://swarajyamag.com/politics/new-restrictions-on-cattle-sale-will-hurt-farmers-badly\" target=\"_blank\">Harish Damodaran, writing for the Indian Express:</a></p>\n<blockquote>In short, it restricts the scope of “animal markets” only to trading of cattle “bought for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter”.</blockquote>\n<p>I’d rephrase this. The scope of “animal markets” covers trading of all animals, with the restriction that cattle trading within the markets should be for agricultural purposes only.</p>\n<blockquote>The underlying objective, it seems, is to segregate milch/agricultural purpose bovines from those intended for slaughter.</blockquote>\n<p>I’d argue that the underlying objective is the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Yes, it also does specify that cattle within the animal markets is limited to agricultural purposes only but making the objective of the entire set of rules on one provision paints a lopsided picture.</p>\n<p>This piece also glosses over numerous items that are now prohibited in entirety under Section 14, including: hot/cold branding, nose/ear cutting, drenching fluids forcibly or using steroids for purposes other than veterinary treatment, castration, tying nose bags and the like, for <em>all</em> animals. Do these not constitute cruelty to animals?</p>\n<p>And even further, we aren’t even discussing <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/meat-eaters-may-speed-worldwide-species-extinction-study-warns\" target=\"_blank\">environment impacts of slaughter</a>, and particularly unregulated slaughter houses.</p>\n<p>We cannot discuss laws without putting them in the right context, and we cannot rule out the cruelty metted to animals while discussing the Act and its Rules.</p>\n<p>Referencing the article above, <a href=\"https://swarajyamag.com/politics/new-restrictions-on-cattle-sale-will-hurt-farmers-badly\" target=\"_blank\">Swarajya Mag adds</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>If traceability and hygiene were the drivers of these rules, why have goats been exempted from this; surely those consuming mutton also have the right to get hygienic meat?</blockquote>\n<p>The hygiene, storing, moving and other restrictions on ensuring proper treatment to animals in the animal markets apply to <em>all</em> animals. In fact, the only restriction specific to cattle is regarding sale within in the animal market as mentioned above. The rest of the provisions apply to <em>all</em> animals, there’s no ambiguity here. I have no idea where this conclusion came from.</p>\n<p>Further:</p>\n<blockquote>The Modi government has a huge employment crisis staring at it in the face; having a few million more people unemployed is only going to hurt it more.</blockquote>\n<p>Sure there will be short term impacts to employment with the new Rules, but should the decision to pass a law focused on <em>preventing cruelty to animals</em> be based on employment? That’s like saying ‘child trafficking shouldn’t be illegal, sure a few children suffer, but think about everyone that’s employed in the child trafficking business’! Is that how these decisions should be discussed, let alone made?</p>\n<blockquote>What these new rules are certainly going to do is increase inspector <em>raj</em> and petty corruption, given the enormous paperwork involved. Illegal trade will flourish. And that will only lead to a step up in the activities of cow vigilantes, who will target even legal transactions. The new rules may have noble intentions behind them, but they may end up doing more harm than good.</blockquote>\n<p>Since we’re speculating now, here’s my postulation: cow vigilantism will only <em>increase</em> if people willing to take the law into their hands feel that the Government is not doing enough via legislation to safeguard cows and start taking matters into their own hands, no?</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>It would be a grave injustice to discuss the new Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Rules without discussing cruelty to animals. There’s a reason people are going from non-vegetarianism to veganism, even without a direct/religious reason to not eat meat: inhumane treatement of animals in production and slaughter facilities. Veganism has estimatedly grown 3.5x in the UK over the last 10 years. Similar estimates say half of vegetarins in the US are vegan, numbering 16 million.</p>\n<p>To only focus on issues with jobs, or new paperwork within the rules and gloss over the prohibition of cruel practices, as well as ensuring decent living and trading conditions within animal markets seems morally wrong to me.</p>\n",

Those raising a large hue and cry over the Government’s decision to introduce Aadhaar verification of students availing the benefit need to understand the numbers, and the leak at stake.</p>\n<blockquote>For instance, Andhra Pradesh — which linked all its 29 lakh government school students to Aadhaar — had 2.1 lakh claimants who existed only on paper.</blockquote>\n<p>It might look small at 7.2% but remember that’s 2,10,000 fake students. And this is just one state.</p>\n<blockquote>In Jharkhand, the names of 2.2 lakh non-existent students have been deleted from school records. So far, 89% of the 48 lakh students enrolled in the state’s government schools have availed of Aadhaar numbers.</blockquote>\n<p>4.4 lakh fake students in just 3 states implies a large leak within the mid-day meal scheme, especially since the way the process works is that a state government receives a contribution from the Centre (Northeastern states receive 90% from the Centre, all other states get 40%) against the number of students receiving the subsidy. In 2015–16, 10.3 crore students availed the subsidy. Even at 7%, the number of ghost students could be 72,00,000!</p>\n<p>The cost incurred by the Central Government is Rs. 4.13 per child per day for primary and Rs. 6.18 per child per day for upper primary. Even at the Rs. 4.13 cost level, we’re looking at estimated leakages amount to Rs. 1000 crores across the Country, and this does not include spending by the states.</p>\n<p>Clearly there is a large leak within the mid-day meal scheme, add to already immense <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-base-fully-safe-and-secure-says-uidai/story-rMkGys9n1UMnzyKO04BAeM.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rs. 49,000 crore estimated to be saved by controlling leakages in LPG subsidy, MNREGA, scholarship and pension schemes</a>.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t even begin on the teacher’s problem:</p>\n<blockquote>A pilot study conducted by Kerala’s department of general education in 2014, after Aadhaar numbers were integrated with the student database, found its schools to have an excess of 3,892 teachers.</blockquote>\n<hr>\n\n<p>In terms of total numbers:</p>\n<blockquote>At present, only 30% of the 11 crore students enrolled in class one to eight at government schools across India possess Aadhaar cards.</blockquote>\n<p>Remember that the Government has clarified that it will not deny benefits for lack of Aadhaar, but will continue to encourage larger enrollment to help weed out the problem.</p>\n",

This nitrification process is what makes the nitrogen, which is 46 per cent in urea, available to the crops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Neem oil basically acts as a ‘nitrification inhibitor’ when coated on urea. By slowing down urea hydrolysis and nitrification, it allows a more gradual release of nitrogen, which can be used by the plant. “Neem-coating increases nitrogen use efficiency. Also, since the urea action is prolonged, the plants stay greener for a longer time. Farmers apply urea when they notice the leaves turning yellowish. But if the crop here is retaining greenness for an extended period, they would reduce the frequency of application. Instead of three bags for an acre of paddy or wheat, they might be using only two now”, Prasad points out.</blockquote>\n<p>Some science behind the ‘magic’ behind neem-coated urea, which might explain the contradiction that although food grain output is rising YoY, fertilizer sales are in fact, down, including that of urea.

He highlights FDI reform, overall growth cross 7% per year, the upcoming Goods &amp; Services Tax, bankruptcy bill, demonetisation, Jan-Dhan Accounts and Direct Benefit Transfer, and the Modi Government’s foreign policy.</p>\n<p>He also makes an interesting point regarding India’s constant election situation:</p>\n<blockquote>At the same time, aspirational Indian voters increasingly manifest a tendency to reward governments that deliver growth and toss out politicians who do not meet performance tests. Strong anti-incumbency instincts keep politicians on their toes.</blockquote>\n<p>I think that the cost and constant election cycle are more detrimental than good, but perhaps the corollary to India constantly analysing everything from an election perspective is that politicians also have to be ‘on their toes’.</p>\n<p>It’s an interesting take overall, correctly grasping the optimism among Indians since 2014, against the overall pessimism in the US since their last election.</p>\n",

S. Thakur, starting with the Centre’s suggestion for a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), which was <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-strikes-down-njac-revives-collegium-system-of-appointing-judges/\" target=\"_blank\">struck down by the Supreme Court in October 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>In December 2015, a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the <a href=\"http://barandbench.com/collegium-supreme-court-leaves-it-to-centre-to-amend-memorandum-gives-suggestions/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Government could amend the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of judges, in consultation with the CJI</a>. The Bench also broadly suggested that amendments towards eligibility of judges, transparency in appointments and establishment of a secretariat to review appointment-related complaints be looked into.</p>\n<p>A bone of contention related to the ‘national security’ clause that the Centre insisted on adding to the eligibility of judges for appointment, and the Secretariat. Progress has been swift since Chief Justice J. S. Khehar took over in January, and the new Collegium has now approved both items.</p>\n<p>Further:</p>\n<blockquote>Finalisation of the MoP, which will be sent to the Centre for approval and adoption this week, raises hopes of speedy filling up of vacancies in HCs, which are operating at below 60% of their sanctioned strength.</blockquote>\n<p>Clearance of pending cases is a huge problem in India. Just last week, the Supreme Court also set out timelines for case hearing, ordering lower courts to <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/supreme-court-conclude-bail-applications-in-1-week-magisterial-trial-in-6-months-sessions-trial-96193be9c09e\" target=\"_blank\">dispense of cases more than five years’ old by the end of the year</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>EVMs have been used in all elections in India since 2000, and began their use in Lok Sabha elections in 2004. Quite naturally, there are a few advantages to the EVMs over the traditional ballot paper usage in India. EVMs are cost-efficient, less prone to booth capture and rigging while also severely reduce polling and counting times. In fact, a Madras High Court judgement from 2005 <a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/605347/\" target=\"_blank\">estimates cost of printing and counting using ballots to be 30–40% of total election expenses</a>.</p>\n<h4>The machines</h4>\n<p>An EVM comprises two units — a Ballot Unit and a Control Unit. The program used in EVMs is burnt into a one-time programmable chip so that it cannot be altered with thereafter. The machines are not networked in any way to ensure prevention of external interference. EVMs are powered by a 6V battery, and therefore do not rely on an external power source.</p>\n<p>In 2006, newer EVMs were introduced with features such as dynamic coding between Ballot Unit and Control Unit, real-time clock, full display, and data and time stamp of each key press.</p>\n<p>The EC has now received approval to introduce an upgrade to the EVM, dubbed the ‘M3’ which <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/all-pre-2006-evms-to-be-replaced-with-new-m3s-7353a8cd2e1c#.cqel52lu0\" target=\"_blank\">will replace all pre-2006 EVMs</a> last used during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This would mean that older machines without the date-time stamp and other features introduced in 2006 will no longer be in use. The newer machines also have a digital verification system to oversee the contact between two component units, making it further tamper proof by turning the machine inoperative upon fault or change in components. 5.5 lakh M3 EVMs have already been ordered, costing Rs. 3000 crore.</p>\n<p>During the 2017 Assembly elections, as part of a United Nations Development Program initiative, <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/13-representatives-from-election-management-bodies-are-in-new-delhi-to-witness-ongoing-assembly-d318acb50cf9#.d2u9iihg1\" target=\"_blank\">5 countries were given briefings on the Indian electoral process</a>, including the use of EVMs and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT).</p>\n<h4>Manufacture</h4>\n<p>Two indigenous companies currently build the EVMs: Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), a PSU under Ministry of Defense, and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL), a PSU under the Ministry of Atomic Energy.</p>\n<p>The EC has <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/all-pre-2006-evms-to-be-replaced-with-new-m3s-7353a8cd2e1c#.cqel52lu0\" target=\"_blank\">requested approval for a third — Central Electronics Ltd. — to be added to help with production of newer M3 units</a>, this approval is still pending.</p>\n<p>The EC notes that various levels of testing is performed at these sites before any machines are put into production, including independent units that perform Quality Assurance of the machines. Further, manufacturers do not have information about candidates several years into the future, or what constituency or the sequence of candidates in the Ballot Unit.</p>\n<h4>Procedure</h4>\n<p>Before every election, the EC begins a series of checks¹:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A first level check (FLC) is done in the presence of political parties’ representatives. Manufacturers certify all components are original within the operational EVMs (malfunctioning EVMs are not used in the election).</li>\n<li>The plastic cabinet of the Control Unit are then sealed, and signed by the parties’ representatives. Access to any internal components does not occur thereafter.</li>\n<li>The parties representatives then randomly select 5% of the EVMs, on which a minimum of 1,000 votes are cast. Results of this ‘mock poll’ and all votes are printed and shared with the representatives, and the poll is videographed.</li>\n<li>EVMs are randomized once for allocation of machines to constituencies, and a second time to the individual polling stations in the presence of candidates or their representatives. Final list of EVM serial numbers allocated to a polling station are provided to the parties or their candidates.</li>\n<li>Candidates and their representatives are allowed to conduct additional mock polls at candidate setting.</li>\n<li>They can also conduct a mock poll before the actual poll on poll day.</li>\n<li>Once the candidate setting is complete, the Ballot Unit of the EVM is also sealed, preventing access to the inside of the Ballot Unit. This is also signed by the candidate/representatives.</li>\n<li>On polling day, a mock poll with a minimum of 50 votes is conducted at each polling station in the presence of representatives.</li>\n<li>An additional thread seal and paper seal are now put on the EVMs to block access to all buttons except those needed for the poll. Candidates/representatives are allowed to sign off on this as well.</li>\n<li>At the end of polling, the presiding officer presses the ‘close’ button on the EVM in the presence of polling agents. No votes can be polled thereafter.</li>\n<li>Now the EVM is sealed entirely, and candidates/representatives are allowed to sign off are they are satisfied.</li>\n<li>Strong rooms where EVMs are sealed between polling and counting. Candidates/representatives are allowed to place their own seals, and have their own watchers. The EC posts its own watchers 24x7.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Historically speaking…</h4>\n<p>Before and after EVMs were introduced, numerous committees were constituted to review their use. To start of, a technical expert committee was appointed by the GoI in 1990, headed by Prof. S. Sampath, with Prof. P. V. Indiresan, and Dr. C. Rao Kasarbada as members. In November 2010, this Committee was expanded to add two additional experts in Prof. D. K. Sharma and Prof. Rajat Moona (now Director General, C-DAC).</p>\n<p>The courts were involved as well. The Madras High Court started by rejecting tampering allegations all the way back in 2001, followed by the Kerala High Court in 2002. In 2004, the Karnataka High Court Judge K S Rai said:</p>\n<blockquote>After thorough practical experimentation and research the present version of EVM is designed. This invention is undoubtedly a great achievement in the electronic and computer technology and a national pride.</blockquote>\n<p>A Mumbai High Court judgement was also issued in 2005.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Hari K. Prasad² along with Alex Halderman and Rop Gonggrijp, published a study wherein they claimed to have proved that Indian EVMs were hackable.</p>\n<p>Their paper implies that it is not a ‘hack’ of the original system using a vulnerability in software, they physically replaced one of the components with a look-alike. This look-alike was then remotely instructed to modify votes. Their second option also involved breaking into the machine between polling and counting since there is often a delay between these two events. In either case, some kind of physical access to the device was needed to perform any tampering, meaning their claims were based on procedural issues in delivering and storing EVMs, and physically replacing components. These issues are addressed by the detailed process described above, and further improved by newer digitally-encoded EVMs.</p>\n<p>Finally, in 2013, the Supreme Court, on petition by Subramanian Swamy overturning the High Court of Delhi, ruled that the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/supreme-court-india-voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trails-must-be-used\" target=\"_blank\">EC needed to add Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system to EVMs</a> as a requirement for free and fair elections, and to add to voter confidence.</p>\n<p>20,000 VVPATs were purchased in 2013, and 33,500 came through in 2016. The assembly elections in Goa had all 40 constituencies with VVPAT.</p>\n<p>In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, VVPAT was available in 8 constituencies. The announcement of the new M3 machines by the EC is congruent with the Supreme Court verdict towards replacing all old EVMs prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>¹ Based on the process as described by the <a href=\"http://eci.pib.in\" target=\"_blank\">Election Commission of India</a>.</p>\n<p>² Hari Prasad was reportedly arrested sometime in 2010. While there is not much additional information, it is believed the reason for his arrest was not his research findings, but the fact that <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Man-who-stole-EVM-in-Mumbai-held-in-Hyderabad/articleshow/6398910.cms\" target=\"_blank\">he had obtained an EVM and refused to reveal his source</a>, as it did not come from the EC.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Updated (9 Apr 2017) to include additional details regarding new M3 EVMs</p>\n",

It is believed that the Heart of Sati Devi fell here, according to <em>Tantra Chudamani</em>.</p>\n<h4>Gabbar</h4>\n<p>The location where Devi Sati’s heart fell is Gabbar parvath. Gabbar also assumes significance in two main time periods in our history — during Ramayan, where Lord Ram and Laxman were told to worship Devi Ambaji at Gabbar, where he was given ‘Ajay’ arrow; and the mundan ceremony of child Lord Krishna in presence of his foster parents Nand and Yashoda.</p>\n<p>A small temple has been built on Gabbar for darshan. For those who cannot climb to visit Gabbar parvath, a Cable car service is available with a lovely scenic view of one side of the mountain.</p>\n\n\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/b0f43-1-9ig5u1ji534urn7kufmow2x.jpeg\">\n</figure><figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/f3485-1ylgk8jbr7nviczizgfnxpg2x.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cable car up to Gabbar.

A convex-shaped Holy Shakti Vishwa Yantra, inscribed with figures and 51 Bijapatra (letters) and the ‘Shree’ syllable is installed such that it is visible for devotion, and cannot be photographed. Non-priests are no longer allowed in the core area around the Yantra.</p>\n<p>The priests decorate the Shakti Yantra such that one can imagine it as an idol of Ma Amba in one of her incarnations, shown on her vahan. Depending on the day of the week, Devi ma is shown to be on a different vahan between a peacock, lion, elephant, etc. I will hopefully post the exact set the next time I’m able to visit.</p>\n<p>About two years ago, a ‘museum’ of sorts has been setup in the temple, where the team shares a bit about the history of the temple and its importance. A replica of the yantra is also available, and it is truly amazing how different the yantra actually is, compared to what you experience in the temple itself.</p>\n<p>Ambaji temple is one of the only places in the world where I experience true peace of mind. As a family, we do try to visit the temple at least once a year.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/f46b5-1mqgeywa5cwpa_xfcfpxmza2x.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gold encased Shikhar as of January 2017.

An estimated 18 — 20 lakh pedesterian pilgrims visit during the festival.

The euphoria of devotees is a sight and feeling to behold, as I was fortunate enough to a couple of years ago. Devotees arrive with their dhwaj’s and are allowed to climb to the side of the Shikhar to hoist it.</p>\n<h4>51 Shaktipeeth replica</h4>\n<p>Lookalike temples of all 51 Shakti Peeth have been created right by Gabbar hills.

Again, while it’s true there’s a drop in absolute level, such two data point analysis misses the fact that PoS is still way above the pre-demonetisation trend.</blockquote>\n<p>This is part of Rupa’s <a href=\"https://ekdrishti.in/while-digitalisation-has-proceeded-cash-has-not-become-unimportant-44345fc93586\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing research into digitisation</a> of the Indian economy overall, including as an effect of demonetization.</p>\n<p>As I have also said before, we are still months away from the ‘final’ picture. The general expectation, and the data seems aligned with this, is the net usage pattern, once the dust well and truly settles will be a larger digitisation of the Indian economy by more than just a few percentage points.</p>\n<p>Bank transactions such as NEFT, IMPS are seeing double digit percentage increases, the only question to be raised is how much of this is force, and how much of it preference.</p>\n<p>She also raises causes for concern:</p>\n<blockquote>…admittedly anecdotal evidence suggests that after an initial adoption of digital payments methods, some smaller merchants and traders are now reverting to cash, since the liquidity crunch has largely eased. By the same token, some consumers are now reverting to cash, which is back in ATMs.</blockquote>\n<p>Rupa is right in suggesting that this isn’t about trying to return to a ‘black’ economy per se, but issues like “high frequency of failed transactions, network issues and high transaction costs” are certainly making cash feel more convenient. There will also be a more general pushback out of desire to return to old habits now that the ‘inconvenience’ of being forced to use digital payments is over.</p>\n<p>BHIM is making good strides to counter this problem (17 million downloads and transactions volumes going up), but digitisation will be well and truly home once banks decide to make it easier to do so. The latest series of bank transacation charges will only put off consumers.</p>\n<p>Until then, cash will always feel and be the ‘cheaper’ option.</p>\n[embed]http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/new-trends-in-digital-transactions/[/embed]\n",

Of these, 194 transactions were performed through Axis Bank, 112 through eMudhra and 91 through Suvidhaa Infoserve.</blockquote>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=158849\" target=\"_blank\">statement issued by the UIDAI</a>, they said:</p>\n<blockquote>With reference to an incident of misuse of biometrics reported in a newspaper, UIDAI said that it is an isolated case of an employee working with a bank’s Business Correspondent’s company making an attempt to misuse his own biometrics which was detected by UIDAI internal security system and subsequently actions under the Aadhaar Act have been initiated.</blockquote>\n<p>It looks like an employee working within the Aadhaar framework played with the data (the UIDAI says it was his own data), and that it was UIDAI that flagged the issue and filed a criminal case against the parties involved. In technical terms, the Aadhaar database was not hacked or breached, but human access of the platform was misused. Moreover, it is the important to note that it is the UIDAI’s own systems that eventually picked up on this misuse.</p>\n<p>But it does raise some of the larger points the opponents of Aadhaar keep highlighting — trusting any entity with data, particularly biometric data, is unsafe by definition. There is though, the point wherein a unique identity system in a country like India where benefits, subsidies and other services are rampant and untraceable, having a unique, two-step verifiable method to verify citizens’ access to schemes, and rooting out corruption has already brought about <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/direct-benefit-transfer-leads-to-rs-50000-crore-savings-for-government-in-3-years/articleshow/57240387.cms\" target=\"_blank\">numerous</a> <a href=\"http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/what-13-million-fake-cooking-gas-consumers-reveal-88357\" target=\"_blank\">benefits</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d love to have a more detailed debate on Aadhaar, one covering the Act, the change in its provisions in March 2016, and the larger point of making where to take Aadhaar in India — including how it is administered/delivered, privacy regulations, and more. Please comment if this is something you’d be interested in doing, and we’ll see how we can give this discussion some shape.</p>\n<p>One final tidbit:</p>\n<blockquote>There has been no incident of misuse of Aadhaar biometrics leading to identity theft and financial loss during the last five years when more than 400 crore Aadhaar authentication transactions have taken place, according to Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).</blockquote>\n<p>Notwithstanding the population of India, that is still a lot of transactions.</p>\n",

The UAE relies heavily on import to cater to its foodstuff needs, and is also a logistics hub in the region. This would mean a ‘dedicated’ farming grounds for the UAE population — an area they are limited in due to soil conditions.</p>\n<p>Additionally:</p>\n<blockquote>India and the Gulf nations, Sinha said, are coordinating their websites and databases to protect expat labour, so Indian workers travelling to the GCC countries don’t get duped by exploitative agents or employers, as has been the case in several countries, notably Saudi Arabia.</blockquote>\n<p>This would probably go down as a substantive reform for Indian labour in the years to come.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://swarajyamag.com/economy/it-wasnt-demo-indias-growth-blues-are-due-to-larger-disruptions-than-just-notebandi\" target=\"_blank\">R Jagannathan, writing for Swarajya</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Well, my advice to both sides is chill. There is no need to garland or shoot the CSO. The higher growth number does not necessarily validate DeMo. At best, we can say that DeMo was a minor disruption compared to the bigger disruptions happening around the world. As for detractors, they will get ample opportunities to pin the slowdown blame on DeMo, since 2016–17 has anyway seen a slowdown in growth relative to the year before.</blockquote>\n<p>Ah, but we don’t know how to chill these days, do we? Or wait until we have enough quantifiable data to comment on something as large as demonetization, instead basing it on one statistic, either way, without establishing context.</p>\n<blockquote>In other words, the deceleration due to DeMo itself may be marginal, but the broader slowdown relative to the last financial year is sharper.</blockquote>\n<p>Another case where <a href=\"https://medium.com/ek-drishti/while-digitalisation-has-proceeded-cash-has-not-become-unimportant-44345fc93586\" target=\"_blank\">macro-context is important when judging what economic statistics reveal</a>. Growth was not at the same levels this year compared to last year in any event, and even without demonetization, an expectation of downturn in overall growth was to be expected. The point is, can we attribute the <em>entire</em> 0.4% drop from the previous quarter to demonetization? Jagannathan postulates, and I agree, that’s a no.</p>\n<blockquote>The reality is that in a world of multiple disruptions there can be no normal level of growth for anybody.</blockquote>\n<p>In Macroeconomics 101, right up in Chapter 1, one of the earliest lessons was that concurrency of two events does not imply causality. Economics is a complex ‘sport’, convoluted enough to stump even seasoned professionals.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>The above data averages show that the basic trajectory of India’s growth was probably in the 5–6 per cent range for a very long time, both pre- and post-reform. The UPA period was an aberration, and high growth was driven by extremely favourable global conditions and by harvesting the fruits of reform sown during the Atal Behari Vajpayee period.</blockquote>\n<p>This is good analysis, and telling when viewed through a larger spectrum (going back all the way to 1985). Our growth pattern has roughly stayed within the same bounds.</p>\n<blockquote>Regardless of whether you measure GDP the old way or the new, we are still to recover fully from the self-inflicted wounds of the UPA era.</blockquote>\n<p>Hurts.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>The lessons for the Modi government are this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>One, keep plugging away at ease of doing business and reforming economic administration. Don’t obsess about the GDP growth rate, or celebrate some good numbers too soon.</blockquote>\n<p>Agree. Think a good GDP outcome highlights the resilience of the Indian economy — against both global headwinds and internal disruptions, including demonetization. There are positive signals, such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/ek-drishti/explaining-q3-high-private-consumption-growth-3178908d49a6?source=collection_home---5------4----------\" target=\"_blank\">higher private consumption growth</a>, or the auto industry — widely believed to be a large struggler post November — <a href=\"https://medium.com/ek-drishti/auto-manufacturers-see-rise-in-february-sales-9f858244d92a?source=collection_home---5------7----------\" target=\"_blank\">reporting higher domestic sales</a>, and know Government collections are expected to go up via collections from both a wider tax base and the final payment of the Income Declaration Scheme 2016 come September 2017. But global conditions, and internal factors such as job slowdowns will need to be navigated.</p>\n<blockquote>Two, big bang and incremental growth are not opposites. When the condition is ripe, go for big bang (GST is one example); when they are not, keep pushing small doses of reform where you can.</blockquote>\n<p>No comment on the advice here, except that I think the Government has done this one thing absolutely right since coming to power. There is scope for deeper analysis on whether every reform was successful or not, but the fact that incremental and big bang reforms have been pursued hand in hand since May 2014 will be hard to argue against.</p>\n<blockquote>Three, get states into the act. The centre cannot be the driving force of the economy. Reforms must touch states, and they hold the key to faster growth.</blockquote>\n<p>Again, some positive moves have already happened, along with the change of revenue sharing, where they’re <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/30dUP67qdzMMYV83n1WLkK/Finance-Commission-suggests-raising-share-of-states-in-centr.html\" target=\"_blank\">steadily increasing revenue sharing with states</a>. Obviously, just the funds aren’t enough, and State initiatives that extend Central initiatives where concurrent control exists have to be strengthened and audited.</p>\n<blockquote>And four, forget about what is our potential rate of growth. We can only discover that by hindsight. In an unstable world, no growth outcome is likely to mirror our expectations. Economic forecasting is no better than astrology. We must negotiate growth in the fog generated by disruptive forces. This is why we got our DeMo forecasts wrong, for global disruptions are DeMo raised to the power of 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But if you still want a number, I would say India’s growth average will be in the 6–7 per cent range in the coming decade.</blockquote>\n<p>I agree with just about everything in this post, except for the prediction numbers. My range would be 7–8 per cent, starting FY2019–20; we can expect the trend to be clear by the end of FY2018–19.</p>\n",

However, whether successful or not in ‘bypassing’ an Income Tax notice, the revenue is on the books and part of the formal economy now.</p>\n<blockquote>(3) Temporary shift of consumer demand from unorganized to organized (taxed) sector so as to able to use cheque she or digital payments based on bank saving , as unavailable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) Temporary shift in production from cash strapped unorganized sector to organized/tax paying sector operating on cheque &amp; formal credit</blockquote>\n<p>As Virmani himself mentions, both these factors repeating themselves will depend on how much of this shifts back to the ‘unorganized’ sector again as cash returns to the economy. While examples of this is still anecdotal as well, I expect a large number within the unorganized sector will choose to move into the organized framework, so the overall trend line will stay steady.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the gains of demonetization starting to prop up growth via expanding the formal accounted economy is starting to show its weight in numbers.</p>\n",

Analyses that only look at trends post-demonetization fail in many ways, particularly in understanding how demonetization was an impetus, not a sudden strategic change in the larger picture. To this point:</p>\n<blockquote>The crux is that those who claim that digitalisation fell in January by looking at only two or three data points completely miss the fact that this is still more than we would have had if demonetisation hadn’t occurred! The narrative of a sharp rise and then drop in digitalisation is simply misleading and based on poor data analysis. Even a cursory analysis of long term trends shows we’re still above trend, due to demonetisation.</blockquote>\n<p>On cash in the economy:</p>\n<blockquote>…while digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant. It’s necessary to stress that this trend for cash incorporates a couple of months of data following demonetisation. If demonetisation indeed leads to less cash in the economy, we should see this elasticity fall over time.</blockquote>\n<p>India has been a predominantly cash economy, and that’s not just a colloquial statement. After all, 1000 and 500 Rupee notes comprised 86% of the denomination in circulation. Even the Government has been focused on the narrative of a ‘less-cash’ economy. While numbers haven’t been revealed yet by the RBI, it does seem that the final cash in circulation number will be far short of the Rs. 15.44 lakh crore that was in circulation on Nov 8.</p>\n<p>Rupa also correctly concludes that the foot cannot be lifted off the peddle now, not for quite a while.

				"title": "Post-demonetization",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I’m not an economist, or any kind of finance wizard. That said, here are the various angles I see from a more macro-economic point of view. There were two main areas in my opinion that were the target of this currency demonetization.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Corruption: India largely thrives on a what is terms as a parallel economy; double account bookkeeping is one of those unwritten ways of managing things. Take the example of real estate, the way to sell or buy property is by division between check payment (i.e., accounted money) and cash (unaccounted and therefore, not taxed). To facilitate this transaction, prices stay inflated. Another example would be wholesale traders who buy (and account for) stock partly officially, partly unofficially. When stock is sold though, traders would want to cover all costs though, so the price will always stay up (cost + tax + profit + cost of unaccounted stock). Sometimes this stock even gets hoarded, causing artificial scarcities which further drives prices up. It is also hard to track this stock since this is kept off book. Tax not paid on these parallel transactions is just one of the problems. What the demonetization has done is invalidate the ‘cash’ aspect of these transactions. Cash collected thus far unaccounted is negated, with further transactions nearly impossible. It also strikes a fear at the heart of these transactions, with murmurs that businessmen and traders are figuring out how to keep their transactions entirely white here on. Even if 20% traders decide this out of those that don’t transact in white, that’s quite a shift.</li>\n<li>Terrorism. India suffers tremendously through cross-border terrorism, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/UnSubtleDesi/status/783631629826691072\" target=\"_blank\">a total of 6,255 jawans have lost their lives</a> (that’s not counting general public). Terrorism is funded primarily through two means — black, unaccounted money or fake currency (termed the Fake Indian currency network, or FICN). By devaluing the currency, a lot of this cash in hand is now useless. By the time the entire outfit resets itself to use the new currency — whether printing, or just getting ahold of cash outside the system — gives India the driving seat, by months at least. Already a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3939368/Maoists-RED-Modi-s-currency-crunch-cripples-Naxal-guerrilla-activities-Rs-7-500-crore-buried-underground-worthless.html\" target=\"_blank\">near-term impact can be seen</a>, schools reopened in Kashmir a couple of days ago, and a 94%+ attendance in exams after unrest that has lasted a quarter. Additional, news has been coming in on a joint India-China task force to crackdown on fake currency.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is a secondary string of ‘benefits’ due to demonetization.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bank liquidity: With the requirement to deposit cash back into bank accounts and the limits in place, there is a massive boost to bank liquidity in the past week. In the first two days alone, approximately INR 53,000 crore was deposited, against INR 700 crore withdrawn. Cash consistently outside the banking system — and I mean accounted/white and black — isn’t great for liquidity, and this turns into a tremendous boost to banks.</li>\n<li>RBI: In hand with (3), there is also a wiping of debt from India’s central bank. An estimated 14 lac crore rupees was out as cash in 500s and 1000s pre-8 Nov. A conservative estimate says 20% of this cash may not return, and since RBI will print new currency against what is accounted, this would mean a reduction in total actual cash that is printed. Using the same estimate, that’s about 2.8 lac crore (in black money) that is wiped out of the economy, and the RBI would only have outstanding currency printed as 11.2 lac crore instead of 14. Again not being an economist I may not be able to fully elucidate every benefit of this but this is definitely a positive. Considering money is being thrown away, and burnt in the aftermath, I do believe this estimate is fairly realistic.</li>\n<li>Prices: prices will come down. Already reports are coming out that wholesalers are dumping stock to compensate losses and fear of transaction issues. A large percentage of real estate transactions will stop seeing the black side of the transactions altogether; resulting in first a slump in prices as the market grapples with the aftermath, followed by a proper correction in prices to more realistic numbers that I believe will still be lower than pre-8Nov values.</li>\n<li>Government dues collections: There is a massive rise in Government dues collections since 8 Nov. Since Govts are allowed to collect payments — taxes, fines and electricity — until Nov 24, a lot of people are attempting to clear out their payments and dues using old currency. This has resulting in an instant rise in Government collections. For example, Maharashtra State Governement and local bodies saw a <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-local-bodies-mop-up-rs400-crore-bmc-nets-rs49-45-crore-in-3-days/story-oecCIRmVEMXk0MvM4mMdjP.html\" target=\"_blank\">collection of INR 400 crore in outstanding dues within 3 days</a>. That’s a start. Railways and Air travel, which is also accepted old notes, have already said <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2016/nov/10/no-cash-refunds-for-cancelled-tickets-above-rs-10000-1537114.html\" target=\"_blank\">no cash refunds will be provided</a> for large transactions to prevent this being used as a currency switcher.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Move to cashless economy</h4>\n<p>I want to address this aspect since it is being brought up a lot. It does seem, if you analyze the Government’s moves since 2014, that there is in fact a gradually increasing nudge towards a more cashless economy (not entirely, but significantly higher than it currently is). Between pushing the poor to open <a href=\"http://www.pmjdy.gov.in\" target=\"_blank\">zero-balance zero-fee accounts</a>, the RBI building a <a href=\"http://www.npci.org.in/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a> for peer-to-peer fund transfers between institutions and finally demonetization requiring money to be deposited back into banks, various areas are already seeing a rise in cashless transactions (cards, check, etc). That said, I do not believe demonetization single handedly solves this; India is still largely a cashless economy. Once lies reduce, cash starts to find its way bank in the hands of the people, cash transactions will resume, especially since various places do not yet have the ability to accept electronic currency and cash is convenient. There will still be a shift, a percentage of people starting to use more plastic and bank transfers to manage in the interim will continue down this path, and the younger generation is more savvy and open to this as well. Gateway providers like PayTM and others will also look to cash in on the demonetization, so that will nudge the economy further.</p>\n<h4>What happens next</h4>\n<p>There’s a lot of talk around ‘this is not enough’, ‘this does not really stop black money’ and ‘how will introducing a higher (2000) denomination solve the problem caused by a lower (1000) denomination’. I think it’s important to remember what this was set out to do: in my opinion, this was to kill black, unaccounted cash out in the economy (and therefore directly attacking existing corruption and terrorism that is elevated by this cash). More has to happen to control further generation, naturally. Remember that simultaneous raids were carried out at 100s of jewelers, various industries around Nov 10 to clarify transfer of cash into these industries in the hope of emptying thus far stashed currency. Other moves such as requiring PAN cards for jewelry transactions above certain amounts are further aimed at limiting new generation. I do believe the real estate sector will be hit next if not already. A crackdown has already been announced against those who have bank deposits not matching their tax returns. These actions will push more and more people to be careful about whether they wish to indulge this route further, and the small percentage that will continue — as they do in every economy — will be far, far smaller than what they were pre-8Nov. The advent of GST expected in FY 2017 will further add to their pain.</p>\n<p>Regarding the currency, it was natural that 14 lac crore in currency would not be circulated entirely in 500s. Someone has highlighted how a different higher denomination also curbs a deposit switcharoo, which has some merit, but is not easy to do. That said, there are two places where the new 2000 denomination really helps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By keeping a larger difference between 500 and the next denomination means the general perception will be to use (and therefore stock on) 500s over 2000s. This means that lesser 2000s will be printed in general (this has been stated anyway), and the difference in wipe out of existing currency in circulation will come out of the 2000 account. This would make it harder to stash the same volumes of currency entirely in black; and the next available denomination is straight down to 500, significantly multiplying the amount of currency required.</li>\n<li>Also remember that getting hold of a 2000 requires some level of routing through the banking system. While an exchange option is available, a citizen is allowed to exchange a maximum of INR4,500 one-time (through filling out a declaration form). Any further 2000s will enter the system through accounted money, via bank withdrawals. This does mean it will be harder to then dispose this currency into the ‘black’ economy, not impossible, but significantly harder. If the tax authorities do their jobs right, unexplained disappearance/inconsistent expenses of currency will be curbed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, I know and fully understand the micro-economic inconvenience being caused while banks come to terms with handling the onslaught of citizens wanted to exchange, switch and withdraw currency to manage their day-to-day. This post in no way minimizes that burden, and a shoutout must go to bank staff who are working double, triple shifts to help people. Various citizens are also visiting banks to distribute water, tea and <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/TajinderBagga/status/797704324407099393\" target=\"_blank\">even help people fill out forms</a> as they stand in line, while switching to majority cashless transactions so they don’t add to lines. It is a testament to the resolve of the country that this is happening across the nation today.</p>\n<p>Onward and upward.</p>\n",

Their message was interesting: custom made frames, good quality glasses, reasonable pricing <em>and </em>for every pair you purchase, they donate one to someone in need.</p>\n<p>WP is an entirely online service (although they do have stores in New York) so the trick would be determining whether the glasses actually work for you. Two items help here. First, WP offers a free home-try on — select 5 frames, and they ship it to you to try on. I was visiting the US earlier this year, so I was able to give this option a go.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/4c768-1hygqoencluvwtoqaustiuw.jpeg\">\n</figure><figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/3b8c7-1bm3oiujy1gdan7zaxs0dug.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">5 frames to try on at home</figcaption></figure><p>Second, one rarely pays attention to the measurement indicators available on each pair of glasses when you visit an option (well, at least I’ve never looked). Based on my current pair, I was able to select frames that were close enough (slightly better, slightly smaller, and similarly sized) to help me decide.</p>\n<p>WP is reasonable with their costs as well: $95 gets you the frames with polycarbonate anti-reflective &amp; UV-protective single-vision glasses, and a one year guarantee for scratches. 1 Warby Parker will ship you just the frames too if you prefer to purchase them without prescription glasses.</p>\n<p>The order process is straightforward. Pick your glasses (and color where applicable), upload a copy of your prescription, and you’re on your way. WP asks that you upload a prescription either with an expiration date, or with a test date taken within the last 2 years. They’re prompt with answers, confirmed they were happy with my prescription scan and the wait began.</p>\n<p>My glasses were delivered within the expected 10 days, although it did take me another week to receive it in this part of the world. I want to add here that the packaging is great too.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/9b3bb-1wp9zpf7yu0-hrwczi03oog.jpeg\">\n</figure><p>Will have to wait and see how durable the frames are, but so far I’m extremely happy with the purchase. The net cost is reasonable for the quality of Glasses currently sitting on my nose though.</p>\n<p>Ya know, I’d love to know more about their donations, while there is some text on their site about the subject, it would add to their feel-good appeal if they shared more pictures of this too.</p>\n<p>For those living outside the US, this option can be a bit tricky, so I’d recommend figuring out a way to try them out first. I’m very likely to go back next time though since I’m confident about the frame sizes and expectations now.</p>\n<p>*flicks hair back* See?</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/4685c-1htdtv9xsbowpwb-r5dfocw.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<ol><li>Progressives cost $195, compressed glasses (for &gt; +/- 4.00 powers) are an additional $30</li></ol>\n",

Wokyo is a simple but effective noodle house, you pick out your ingredients and they ‘wok’ it up in front of you, fresh as ever.</p>\n<p><span>W</span>okyo attempts to keep things fairly authentic on their menu — it’s not a complex menu at that, the main course being noodles or rice, cooked in the sauce you select and the protein of choice. They do carry other appetizers and a couple of salads as well so this is handy if you’re in a larger group. However, their noodle servings are quite satisfactory per person.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/018f7-12kbgpb23lvpcopne8fn0tq.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sauces on trial.</figcaption></figure><p>In total, Wokyo boasts 8 different sauces — from the Bangkok Coconut Curry to the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame. Their ambience feels pretty fresh and mostly friendly. The only caveat in our experience was when I asked the server repeatedly to explain what the sauce ingredients were so I wouldn’t have to look them up off the menu (Seoul is Fiery Sriracha for example), he kept pointing out that the names were next to the sauces already, and I kept trying to explain that I wanted to know what Seoul contained. After a couple of tries, it was just easier to read them off the menu. Wokyo lets you try out the sauces upfront, which is neat.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to cover as much of the menu possible, we chose different noodle types (and one steamed rice option) each with a different sauce. I do believe certain combinations would work better than others — the Buckwheat noodles for example may not work that well with something like the Peanut, but an exhaustive list of recommendations would take me too many tries to perfect. Sorry!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ebe33-19tot9qb2dmfxjeuedmnnva.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">In focus: Udon noodles in Bangkok Coconut Curry, with lotus root chips behind them.</figcaption></figure><p>We sampled the Fiery Sriracha, the Bangkok Coconut Curry, the Thai Peanut, the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame, the light soy. Of these, the one that didn’t work for me was the Thai Peanut — the end result was very dry and a bit tough to enjoy. My guests preferred the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame which was delicious, while my personal choice of light soy with buckwheat noodles was also really good. The noodles were all well cooked so we had no complaints there. I personally love buckwheat noodles, but for the traditional noodle eaters, Egg noodles and Udon are both available. One point, if you order the rice option, you would receive the proteins or veggies cooked in sauce, with rice steamed on the side, unlike the noodles which are mixed in.</p>\n<p>In addition to a Lavazza coffee bar, Wokyo also has your more traditional Thai Iced Tea and Matcha tea options, hot and cold. I stuck with my tested Matcha Iced Tea latte (soy milk) and that worked well.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/d89e3-1rxi4cusw9rsf8j2i5ixjvw.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Matcha iced tea latte.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, it’s an enjoyable experience, the interiors are fun, just a little quirky and they’ve given the outside area good lighting, which was very appreciated (and resulted in better than average pictures).</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/29b02-1ipkpcmrvuwqafxyi6yblqa.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A little space for your bags by each table.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Rating breakdown </strong><br>Ambience: 4<br>Service: 3.5<br>Food: 4<br>Authenticity: 3.5<br>Value for money: 3.5<br><strong>Final</strong>: <strong>3.7/5</strong></p>\n<p>(Ratings are explained <a href=\"https://naihar.com/food-reviews-ratings-2bc9eff36d9b#.md8vqkinv\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wokyo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Wokyo Noodle Bar</strong></a><strong> </strong>• <a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/dubai/wokyo-noodle-bar-jumeirah-lake-towers\" target=\"_blank\">Zomato</a><br>Below Bldg J2, Cluster J, JLT, Dubai<br>+9714 4551690</p>\n",

Second, it didn’t help that <em>Farzi</em> has a few things really going for it and others that hold it back.</p>\n<p>Let me table the suspense first up: the two restaurants don’t really fall in the same class, and you’d be disappointed if you, like me, compared your experiences. It also wouldn’t really be fair to <em>Farzi Café</em>, so we’ll endeavor to let it stand on its own.</p>\n<p><span>F</span><em>arzi</em> truly represents Dubai’s unending obsession with the new &amp; different. ‘Reservations are completely full until Sunday,’ we were informed the first weekend. The earliest weekend booking I could make on a Tuesday was for Saturday, and they weren’t kidding. The scene was crowded when we arrived.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/63493-1_lx-s_fvbapdb1jcdjaala.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Big menus, loads of white space and a little table.</figcaption></figure><p>Right away, we were introduce to Problem One: while their interiors are done up well, the tables are incredibly cramped. I believe our table would have served maybe three people at best (we were 5) and was incredibly narrow, making the person sitting along the edge (yours truly) struggling for space. Behind us were a family of 9; their table while longer was not any wider. We barely got over the grumbling when Problem Two was dumped on us: a humungous (in context of the table) menu.</p>\n<p>Restaurants should really think this stuff through, and this turned out to be the most irritating thing about <em>Farzi</em>. Two people sitting across from each other couldn’t place their menu face down on the table without colliding, only made worse when you have 3 people sitting at one end. (Spoiler: we just shared our menus). This was made worse by the design of the menu itself; I have no problem with funky (there were cute quotes in each section too) but reading up dish names with four different font styles starts to get irritating while you elbow your dinner companions. All the while, I couldn’t help thinking that a smaller font would have lead to a smaller menu (most pages only had 4 items listed) and a significantly more comfortable reading experience. You essentially sit there hoping the food has some redeeming qualities.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/38fbf-1i7rxzbxqjvhjdagc11znvw.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sorry, but that’s just irritating to read. I don’t mind funky, but pick one style at a time?</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, there is hope. Their drinks menu — a welcome surprise of sanity-prevailing smaller fonts bound in a rather compact looking menu — is extensive, and concoctions likekadak chai soda and curry leaf mocktail turned out to be delicious even if a little too sweet. The waiter informed us the drinks were pre-made and there was no option to have a non-/less- sugar version. Tough.</p>\n<p>The problem persisted with the Raj Kachori. While a delectable presentation with use of a chutney foam, spicy pumpkin mash on the inside and fried okra, the yogurt was far (far) too sweet for my taste buds, taking it almost into the dessert category. A little adjustment here would do wonders to the dish.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/2317a-1n1mvbcama4sgn3z93dlfqa.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Raj Kachori: Stuffed with sweet yogurt and spicy mashed pumpkin, side of fried okra and covered in sweet chutney foam.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Farzi</em> tries to be inventive with their food, which works in some cases, and isn’t a home run, but still good. The curry leaf mocktail was actually delicious, the okra-pumpkin touches in the Raj Kachori inspired, and the truffle sliders were heartwarming for a truffle/mushroom lover (and arrived in a US army truck of all things). There was also the aubergine steak (yes, aubergine), topped with babaganoush and a side of salan sauce, which was absolutely the highlight of the menu. The paneer tikka wasn’t the most inventive of dishes, but still cooked well although the presentation was a little messy.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/8c6a3-1amhbv9ytv3qea4vceic3qa.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The aubergine steak: Grilled eggplant stuffed with babaganoush, side of salan sauce and Ajwain naan. Perfect.</figcaption></figure><p>I did however feel <em>Farzi</em>’s menu was also a tad limited. Not that they didn’t have enough options, but a case in point: the appetizers section had tandoori chili cheese kulchas, and also a paratha enchiladas. While technically different, it was two versions of the same thing. I trust they’ll expand as time goes on, but it took a bit of effort to try and find enough different styles or dishes to sample for a larger group.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/27889-1hlhu_dxwk9ek1bvmndovew.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sir, sliders reporting, sir! Truffle mushroom sliders in homemade buns</figcaption></figure><p>There was another dish that was served up in a red telephone booth, and the bill &amp; comment card arrived on a typewriter. It’s a cute idea no doubt, but again, perhaps a smaller typewriter that didn’t eat up most of the table would have been a cleaner touch.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/abb4f-1huvzu482pc0kpmhqfaphwq.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Typewriter, with a side of your bill.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Farzi</em>’s outside seating only caters dessert, and you have to be seated inside for their full menu. We didn’t land up trying dessert; I didn’t mind since I had been downing the two rather sweet drinks all through dinner. I almost sound like a broken record now, but each time a dish was served up, something had to be moved around or taken off the table. Rarely were two dishes served at once, so the eating experience is a bit disconnected.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, I see why <em>Farzi Café</em> is the current hotspot in the city. Good flavors coupled with interesting presentation and the ‘ooh shiny’ new factor work in its favor. Is that enough to take away from the negatives? Somewhat. It will be interesting to see how Farzi continues to draw in the crowds, particularly with newer inventive dishes.</p>\n<p>It’s good, but not great. I felt <em>Farzi</em> fell slightly short of the finish line; I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for larger groups looking to sample everything, but it’s worth trying as a new experience.</p>\n<p>But I genuinely hope their management reviews the seating arrangement; this is undoubtedly their weakest link.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Rating breakdown </strong><br>Ambience: 2<br>Service: 4<br>Food: 3.5<br>Inventiveness: 4<br>Value for money: 3.5<br><strong>Final</strong>: <strong>3.4/5</strong></p>\n<p>(Ratings are explained <a href=\"https://naihar.com/food-reviews-ratings-2bc9eff36d9b#.md8vqkinv\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.farzicafe.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Farzi Café</strong></a> • <a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/dubai/farzi-cafe-al-safa\" target=\"_blank\">Zomato</a><br>City Walk Phase 2, Al Safa, Dubai<br>+9714 3942556</p>\n",

Recently, even <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/once-a-month-pm-narendra-modi-steps-in-to-revive-stalled-projects-1238011\" target=\"_blank\">reports of Mr. Modi’s project management</a> — things I’ve heard many times in Gujarat—have been shared. This is how he works, and Mr. Modi will always be the man for long term implementation vision &amp; capabilities — something I have seen myself over the last 10 years in Gujarat.</p>\n<p>But things are more center stage now for him. And a strong counter narrative to his efforts has been in the making since May last year. But let’s be honest, the <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/politics/hook-line-and-sinker-modis-media-baiters-laid-a-trap-for-him-and-he-walked-into-it-2482626.html\" target=\"_blank\">GoI hasn’t entirely helped</a>, and a lot of the narrative problems are internal to the BJP (which sadly affects the GoI directly). Leaders like Shatrugan Sinha who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShatruganSinha/status/655612079840235521\" target=\"_blank\">openly give importance to comments</a> against the party, and <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjps-kailash-vijayvargiya-makes-friends-and-controversies-easily-1240154\" target=\"_blank\">various other sideliners</a> who loudmouth (and sometimes get sucked into) ridiculous comments clearly does not go down well in the electorate. It is unfortunate that every single BJP comment is highlighted to the skies, while ridiculous comments made otherwise are sidelined quickly. Let’s not even get into the <a href=\"http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-is-the-supreme-court-angry-with-sanjiv-bhatt/\" target=\"_blank\">Sanjive Bhatt episode</a> that barely saw the light of day, and was mostly kept to online versions.</p>\n<p>The counter-Modi narrative worked in Delhi, and we now know it has worked in Bihar. Everything from AwardWapsi, Dadri and Kalburgi has stuck. The technicality clearly doesn’t matter; whether the GoI is directly responsible or not can be argued till the sun goes down but it doesn’t matter. The perception is clearly sticking and working against the narrative Mr. Modi (and the BJP) has painstakingly built leading to May 2014. The Congress in particular has been smart, and have carefully used non-Congress voices knowing that the electorate was less likely to hear them out based on their voting history as well.</p>\n<p>There is also growing resentment around the fact that the justice timeframe in India is far too slow. No doubt, the GoI continues to take steps to solve that problem, but the fact that numerous accused are roaming free—take the case of Lalu Yadav who has won the election in Bihar while out on bail, and he’s convicted—reflects badly on the GoI and for the future of India as a whole. <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bikaner-land-grab-case-enforcement-directorate-searches-premises-of-delhi-firm-1239415\" target=\"_blank\">Even when some effort is being made</a>, it is largely swept under the carpet.</p>\n<p>I can’t say that I know Mr. Modi well; I actually don’t at all. But I can somewhat say that I know his ability to work and succeed beyond what the rhetoric may say about him. This defeat too shall pass. The opposition will do better than to underestimate him as a person, and his political will. He will continue to have my support &amp; <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/09/17/1-the-modi-phenomenon/\" target=\"_blank\">the support of the country</a>. But it is now time to evaluate some of the strategy, the media, the loudmouths and forces that hamper the future of our country, and his own office. And the message has to be equally cumulative.</p>\n",

You’re trekking down an alleyway, following the advice of a must-visit place where ‘everything on the menu is delicious’. And you’re dying for a salad after a week long gluttony that comes with travel.</p>\n<p>As you perspire your way to the door, you’re greeted with a quaint, bustling, cozy little cafe that has extra stools hanging upside down on the walls. Interesting.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>The Nutcracker </em>itself, a table seems almost hard to find at lunchtime, and there’s little room to wait. Thankfully this phase of our journey only lasts about 10 minutes and we’re ushered to a table.

Its ambience, fragrance and decor transported us away from the Dubai hustle and bustle to a place where fresh bread, delicious soups and pastries can be had multiple times a day without any effect to your waistline. The influence was completed by French music playing away above us, and an extremely smiling wait staff. I think I’d have melted if they spoke to me with a French accent, but alas, that wasn’t to happen.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/052e9-0a3uuuvvqks_77fkh.jpg\">\n</figure><p>The menu is diverse, covering soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastries, you know the drill. I can confirm that the French Onion soup is the best I’ve ever had, served in a lovely crusty bread and I absolutely need to go back for a sandwich that had some combination of organic bread, green apples and goat cheese.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/5d7b3-0ggj1bfs-jujvia9n.jpg\">\n</figure><p>I was also pleasantly surprised by a mocktail — peach puree, pineapple and…spinach. I only agreed to try it out of utter curiosity — a spinach and peach drink? — and I learnt that it was not just possible but that spinach, when added subtly can enhance a peach puree brilliantly. We concluded that the chef clearly knows his combinations. Worth a try.</p>\n<p>A visit to a patisserie cannot be complete without dessert. The chef’s recommended strawberry cheesecake was extremely fresh, and different compared to the usual American cheesecake varieties I’m used to. And the little star was the White Forest, baked with a hint of pineapple.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/9e943-0vakwauumw9wq6e2r.jpg\">\n</figure><figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/713c2-0z0_gmfbnfffzzy9y.jpg\">\n</figure><p>All in all, it was a lovely getaway, and thankfully not inside a mall.

I was — having loved their menu during my last visit to the US, not to mention all the Big Bang Theory love — but when I learnt of the long wait times, decided I should let some time pass before trying it out.</p>\n<p>Not that it mattered. We ventured down to celebrate a birthday, and, lo and behold, the lines had not died down at all. “1.5 hours” said the polite hostess as she handed us a little buzzer that would let us know when our table was ready. Yup, that’s how organized their wait cycle is.</p>\n<p>And how long their lines still are.</p>\n<p>(Btw, that’s the waiting line to get on the waiting list for a table.)</p>\n<p>We opened with the lettuce wraps, something I had tried and loved <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">during my US visit</a>, and was curious to see how that translated over.</p>\n<p>‘Rather well’ is the answer. The produce was fresh, the sauces delicious as always and the appetizer gained a thumbs up around the table.</p>\n<p>What is a bummer though: they’re not selling their dressings &amp; sauces like <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">they do in the US</a>. Bummer, bummer.</p>\n<p>I have to talk about the ‘eggplant burger’ — it’s not exactly called that on the menu — but it is, by far, the best rendition of a grilled eggplant anything I’ve had at a meal. Wrapped in a burger bun, topped with fresh melted cheese &amp; grilled onions and cooked to absolute perfection.</p>\n<p>The waiter might have been confused what the sandwich looked like (we were told it was a flatbread sandwich rather than a burger), but the chef most certainly was not. You may be a meat eater or an eggplant hater, but you’re going to have a hard time saying no to this. Ya hear me, Poston?</p>\n<p>I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to classify the Factory into a specific cuisine, but at least they do them all well. With over 200 items on the menu, deciding what to eat was hard.</p>\n<p>We figured quesedillas were as different as the food was going to get, and these deserve a mention for being served with the freshest guacamole (yes, just about everything we had that afternoon had some avocado in it, but no regrets), delicious salsa and rich sour cream. The quesedillas were kept simple, just the way I like them.</p>\n<p>No celebration is complete without a slice of cheesecake — well, no visit to the Factory is complete without one either — and, <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">just like in the US</a>, their staff obliged with a little deco to make the slice look as festive as possible.</p>\n<p>What’s interesting overall about my experience is the consistency. Even the look and feel of the decorated plate matched its US counterpart. Don’t believe me? <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look for yourself</a>.</p>\n<p>The food was delicious, fresh and something you’d definitely want to go back for. The place is buzzing with activity, and if you can get around the incredible wait times — to be fair, it can’t be that hard to kill time in the Dubai Mall right? — you’re in for a treat.</p>\n<h4>The Cheesecake Factory</h4>\n<p>The Dubai Mall, opposite the Aquarium</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Originally published on Dec 10, 2012.</em></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<h4>The reporting on Election 2014 is going from bad to worse.</h4>\n<p>Before you get into a bunch, I do understand the <em>The Newsroom </em>is an idealistic show, meant for TV. Even Aaron Sorkin, the show’s creator, <a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/04/22/aaron-sorkin-newsroom-apology/\" target=\"_blank\">admits the show was not written to show journalists how to cover the news</a>. But it doesn’t mean there aren’t a few cues to be taken. I’ve spent some time in collegiate journalism — that’s not to say it was lesser than regular journalism, we were bound by the same ethics codes dictated by the Associated Press. I still use ‘em’ vs ‘en’ dashes rather than just hyphens as you will find in this blog. We were also guideline’d when it came to facts, reporting about ourselves, and authenticity of sources. And I think here the Indian media has a lot to learn.</p>\n<p>Election season is afoot in the world’s largest democracy, and in my attempt to track it as well as understand it, I rely on the media. Off late though, I find that I spend more time reading and looking at source interviews rather watch TV or rely on a lot of media, because I find the focus is TRP rather than fact or focus, points I raise in more detail below.</p>\n<p>Aside from the show, idealism and fanfare, for me the key to <em>The Newsroom </em>lies in this key phrase: ‘..<em>nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed electorate’.</em></p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Where are the facts?</strong></p>\n<p>Spend 20 minutes on any TV channel and all you will hear is ‘Rahul Gandhi said this today’ and ‘Narendra Modi said that’. Shouldn’t there be some responsibility towards actually representing the facts? Correcting them if they are wrong?</p>\n<p>As an example, when Rahul Gandhi says tons of land was given away at ridiculous (he actually says INR1 per sq. m) to the Adani Group by the Government of Gujarat. Narendra Modi claims in return that there is no wrong doing and the Supreme Court validated their land deals. Instead of the headline ‘Gandhi family makes its strongest attack on Modi’ and ‘Modi sharpens attack on the Gandhis’, shouldn’t you perhaps spend some time to review the Supreme Court verdict that says the <a href=\"http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/land-act-a-fraud-learn-from-gujarat-says-sc/827449/\" target=\"_blank\">model by which the Govt. of Gujarat allocated this land should be replicated by other states</a>?</p>\n<p>Conversely, when people like Uma Bharti allege that Robert Vadra would go to prison over misdealing in land ownership, the Congress comes out to defend him. Great, but shouldn’t you rake up evidence of no-wrongdoing, or bring up public records of the Government land deals that are a matter of public record, or at least should be?</p>\n<p>Instead the media spend time running from one party to another asking for a comment rather than doing any work.</p>\n<p>One more example just to drive home the point. In Rahul Gandhi’s constituency of Amethi (he’s the incumbent MP), Priyanka Vadra (his sister who is campaigning for him there) and Smriti Irani (running for the same seat) are fighting that the other never visits the constituency. So get on it, visits and interviews are public record. Prove either one of them wrong!</p>\n<p>What is equally bad are the translations and misrepresentations. I can’t even get into the examples here but I urge the media to translate and quote correctly. Enough headlining.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Where is the focus?</strong></p>\n<p>Sit through an evening debate and the only thing the anchors and channels want to talk about is how bad was one person’s statement over another. There’s never a discussion of facts — often, it’s a direct misquote — but moreover, there doesn’t seem to be any focus either.</p>\n<p>Take the example of Mumbai which went to vote last week. Initial estimates say anywhere between 3 and 6 lac names were unavailable, Was there a debate (not talking just a quick newsbite) on the item? Nope. Did anything raise a fuss over the action taken by the Election Commission (<a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/election-commission-admits-mistake-on-its-part-over-mumbai-electoral-roll-fiasco/articleshow/34194059.cms?google_editors_picks=true\" target=\"_blank\">they apologized and said they would fix it before the next election for the State Elections in two years</a>)? Nope.</p>\n<p>Here’s another. On the same day, half of Bollywood decided to honor their yearly commitments to IIFA and attend the IIFA Awards in Florida rather than vote. Except a passing mention on the channels, who chose instead to highlight and interrupt coverage with ‘Breaking News’ when they spotted a new celebrity coming to vote, there was not a single debate. I only found IndiaTV take the coverage a little further, and spend time asking actors at IIFA in the US about the fact that they did not vote. Most of the response revolved around contractual obligations. Anupam Kher even went so far as to say, and I quote, ‘for me India is first’, but we have contractual obligations. Let’s not forget here that there was a large and vocal outreach on voting made by Bollywood to vote for a secular government.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Where is the bias?</strong></p>\n<p>In the early episodes of <em>The Newsroom</em>, the editorial team insist anchor Will McAvoy make clear he is a Republican, something he has shied away from declaring prior to the start of the show’s timeline. This was interesting. The journalism I’m attuned to needs to be as neutral as possible, but I understand in this day and age, and in political discourse, it is a different story.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear that there is nothing wrong with having one. Journalists are voters too, and have every right to view their choice. But declaring this choice helps unskew their reporting. Knowing McAvoy is a republican makes it that much more credible when he then takes on a Republican candidate on fact. Simultaneously, he can no longer just hardline at the Democrats because his bias would make his interviews less credible. His responsibility increases as a result to stay closer to, and argue on facts, since anything else would make him less relevant.</p>\n<p>The same must apply to the Indian media. I’m not saying everyone needs to come out and say whom they are voting for, just that it needs to be less biased and more factual. When you are held so closely to your bias, you automatically need to stay on facts to be relevant.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>Make of this what you will. Recently, in an interview by ABPNews, an interviewer asked PM candidate Narendra Modi if the media should fear him if he comes to power. Barring the sadness of this thought process, the answer is impressive indeed. Slightly paraphrased, Modi said ‘If you’re scared of a political leader, you shouldn’t be in the media. For a democracy to function, the media needs to be strong.’ The interview is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxEUhhPmMs#t=2828\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for verification.</p>\n<p>Criticism by the media, holding our public figures accountable is paramount. It’s not about being scared of a political party or a leader; but it’s also not about sensationalism. Everything is not breaking news. You have a responsibility to present the factual truth, and in this regard and my opinion, you’re failing miserably.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>© <a href=\"http://www.qtab.com\" target=\"_blank\">QTAB.com</a>. Full technical specs are <a href=\"http://qtab.com/index.php?id=7\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Souq.com launched their <a href=\"http://qtab.com/index.php?id=1\" target=\"_blank\">QTAB</a> tablet last year. Shaped much like the iPad mini — so much so that a couple of people mistook it for one while it sat on my desk — the QTAB is a barebones Android device that arrives with a couple of hardware quirks.</p>\n<p>A closer look of the device and the differences from the standard comparison devices are apparent. For starters, the QTAB has both its hardware buttons at the top — power on the top left, home on the top right. While change is sometimes good, I can’t say this was an easy transition. I often found myself hitting the home button to sleep/wake the device. Similarly the volume buttons are soft touch at the bottom of the screen — something easily forgotten when you want to quickly turn up and down the volume.</p>\n<p>Experienced tablet users would be easily annoyed by these changes; however, first time users — and I believe this is where the QTAB is looking to target the market — should just use this as a baseline instead without too much fuss.</p>\n<p>The other area where I believe the QTAB has some work to do is boot up. Restarting the device takes some time (and I found myself restarting it fairly often to clear out the wifi connection, for example) — I timed it at 41s during one restart. This is particularly interesting since there didn’t seem to be any bloatware installed on the device. Normally this wouldn’t be a bother; but when the device stayed idle for a few hours, it would refuse to connect to the wifi unless rebooted.</p>\n<p>So let’s talk about the market. The official statement is that the QTAB is targeted for the Arab region, and particularly for education. I’m not sure what is special about the QTAB for the market (other than price, but they’re not the only one playing in that range), but I can see the value for education. Souq.com’s backing would mean institutions would be able to setup good warranties compared to some of the other players. The QTAB serves as a basic device that would meet the needs of browsing and reading. There is also a large market in this region for first time, basic tablet users who want to be able to read email, view Facebook and maybe make a Skype call or two — and give them away as gifts to others and kids. From what I’ve seen in that space, if they put the right resources behind it and iron out the quirks, the QTAB should do just fine.</p>\n",

The build quality is very good. You know, the kind built for very long hours of use. The kind that make you want to stroke them with your fingers...well, you get the idea. Indeed, this is some fashionable design done in collaboration with French designer <a href=\"http://www.starck.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Philippe Starck</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/15e9b-0-a-6yjyt4q-dmm6f.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy Parrot Source: [www.parrot.com/zik/usa/t...](http://www.parrot.com/zik/usa/touch)</figcaption></figure><p>The highlight feature on the Parrot Zik is the <strong>touch/gesture controls</strong> on the ear piece. I was a bit apprehensive at first but there is a simplicity in its use, and the gestures will come naturally to the current smartphone generation — tap to answer (if paired with a phone), slide to switch song (tried with iTunes) , slide up and down for volume— all of which work without any additional setup. Dropping the phones to your shoulder pauses music play; lifting it back to your ears resumed music. No fuss at all.</p>\n<p>The gesture controls actually bring a fun element to the Zik. I do hope that there isn’t a lag in these controls over prolonged use. There’s also a nice soft click noise to give you feedback during the gestures.</p>\n<p>The headphones also feature <strong>two microphones</strong> with a jawbone sensor to help pick up vibrations in addition to the sound. Any skepticism of it being a marketing gimmick were washed away with a few calls — no one I spoke to even commented that I was using headphones until I asked them for an opinion — quite a seamless experience. The voice quality transmitted is very good, considering microphones that don’t make you feel like you’re about to command an Airbus (seen in the cover picture).</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/f8e5b-0iwk2qudevwhjjco6.jpeg\">\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>When I handed the headphones to my 2-year-old nephew who’d come visiting, he had no hesitations placing it over his ears and enjoying the beat until the fact that it was a little too big for his head brought it down to his neck. But no matter, he rocked the DJ vibe!</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Noise cancellation</strong> works well — there is a slightly unnerving suction-type action at its start — something they could probably improve on — but otherwise effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery life</strong> is good and lasted a full day for me with ‘normal’ use — some music, switching between my phone for calls on the go, and the laptop for music and a couple of Skype calls at my desk. What’s interesting to note is you can use the Zik as regular headphones when the battery runs out too, albeit without any of the geek snazz that makes the Zik what it really is.</p>\n<p>Parrot also has an <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parrot-audio-suite/id523117085?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS app</a> available that allows additional fun tuning with a quick pairing, that should make advanced users happy as well.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>There’s a large market for quality headphones, and considering this is their first offering, Parrot packs a forward-thinking punch with the Zik. The innovative use of touch controls and easy set up means my mother could start using it intuitively with her iPad and wouldn’t let go thereafter.</p>\n<p>Could we be looking at the future of hearing devices? I think so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/63376557251/parrot-zik\" target=\"_blank\">Cross posted on my blog</a>.</p>\n",

When I would call, invariably disturbing your studying, I’d ask if I was interrupting. Your response was always “No, no. I was just about to take a break anyway.” You didn’t fool me Rubeen, my timing can’t have been that spectacular every time.</p>\n<p>That time in January, when we all ate the chocolatiest chocolate cake while you played the guitar for us.</p>\n<p>Or my birthday last October. <em>(pictured above)</em></p>\n<p>Or yours this year, as we watched our friend obliterate a baked potato.</p>\n<p>Or Adopt-a-Camp, when we were exhausted from waiting and packing, you wouldn’t leave and continued to help.</p>\n<p>Or the first day of Ramadan last year, when you got lost (as usual) and demanded I sit in the passenger seat and just show you how to get to the parking near Hard Rock. That morning and the next, I shared something significant in my life with you.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>On the first day of Ramadan this year, how things changed.</p>\n<p>There was a sincerity in your conversations that made it very easy to talk to you. Your struggles through your research, visits up and down Abu Dhabi, your canceling of plans to go out so that you could attend to the health of a stray cat and crazy entrepreneurial ideas. Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve learnt that your stories are exponentially larger in volume.</p>\n<p>I hope you didn’t suffer too much, because you didn’t deserve to. You’ve left your mom and dad in your brother’s capable hands, and we’re all here for them. I know you fought hard, and you are now at peace.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>They used to tell us, when we were younger, as kids, when we asked about all this … that when God loved someone a lot, He would take them away young. I don’t think I ever fully believed that. But it does seem to be the case here. You are remembered a lot down here, but it is clear He loved you just a little more up there.</p>\n<p>The jokes about my 3-women limit will never be the same again. But you’ll always be one of the original and only Hard rock team.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Ameen.</p>\n",

A close friend had suffered a brain hemorrhage the previous day.</p>\n<p>The shock has still not left me. Her voice still rings in my ears from our last call, making plans to meet. Her family stands around her, praying for the miracle. Her brother, also a close friend, has not left her side as she fights.</p>\n<p>It took three days before I would break under the weight of the situation, and will take many more before I will come to terms with the shock.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>I think the fragility of life is something we all deal with. Whether it comes because of our own experiences or others, we are often jolted into reality by instances like these.</p>\n<p><em>What if.</em></p>\n<p>I remember a poem called <em>Leisure </em>from my childhood rather distinctly; its words still stuck in my head all these years:</p>\n<blockquote>What is this life if, full of care,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We have no time to stand and stare.</blockquote>\n<p>I think we are mostly aware that we take life for granted from time to time. Things are set, there is a routine, and we forget that it takes one thing to change it all.</p>\n<p>I suddenly feel very conscious of everything around me, the activities, the people. This all still feels a little surreal, like I’m going to wake up in the morning and everything will be as it was June 26.</p>\n<p>Realizing life can be fragile is not fun. Millions wonder what happens to us after we pass; but I think what has stood out for me over the last few weeks is watching the impact we have on people around us while we’re here. The pain caused cannot be described in words ofcourse, but it is remarkable to hear the stories, the smiles shared among friends and family, the sorrow of maybe an unpleasant conversation, the longing for that one last meeting to happen, the impact of a lovely person.</p>\n<p>I learnt.</p>\n<p>I learnt to stop and stare.</p>\n<p>I learnt, even more, to tell people I care.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>At D8, one of the last major appearances of Steve Jobs, he was asked if he would add anything to his famous Standford Commencement Speech of 2005. He responded:</p>\n<blockquote>…probably I would just turn up the volume on it, because the last few years have reminded me that life is fragile.</blockquote>\n<hr>\n\n<p>To RN, we are all right by your side. You’ve had a profound impact on the lives of people who met you, and on a lot of people who didn’t. Over the last couple of weeks, we have admired and shared stories of things you did, day in and day out, admiring and valuing life — people and animals alike.</p>\n<p>I pray for you every day.</p>\n",

Yahoo themselves, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Yahoo!\" target=\"_blank\">have a huge list of them</a>, and the track record isn’t something to write home about just yet. But over the last few months, I do feel that Marissa Meyer’s moves have been largely positive towards Yahoo’s own spirit. The Tumblr announcement itself came in parallel with the long, long, long awaited <a href=\"http://blog.flickr.net/en/2013/05/20/a-better-brighter-flickr/\" target=\"_blank\">major redesign to emancipated child Flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>And I will admit the initial signs are good.

When my mom first saw that ID (I used to put it up as part of a wall collage of things I had done at my apartment in Philadelphia), her first reaction was ‘You look exactly like Nanaji did when he was in college.’</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bc106-099hg4ve4ua79vkgo.jpg\"></figure><p>I remember being supremely impressed by Nanaji when I stayed with my grandparents over the summer by myself in the 9th grade. As a routine, every morning at 7 a.m. you would see him fly out the door; he was a man who could not sit still. Laziness was so unknown to him that I am sure my lazy genes have all come from my paternal side. It was clockwork. Out the door at 7, back at 11.45 for lunch at noon sharp. Mind you, he needed his food piping hot, to the point where I had to sit for a bit before I could even consider eating. Back out again in the afternoon, back again for dinner punctually at 7, a habit you did not stop until last week. Nanima may have spoilt me with food and sweets throughout my stay, but Nanaji impressed me with pure action and few words.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple years, I was sad every time I visited you, watching you go from being house-ridden to bed-ridden, unable to move around on your own, your eyes still showing the fight and energy, but your body unable to keep up with the pace. You suffered for someone so active, so determined to be out of the house whenever you could. You made random, silly excuses to leave the house; you’d tell Nanima you needed to get the mail (downstairs) and disappear for a half hour because everyone told you you shouldn’t be out as much.</p>\n<p>You loved technology and new things. You were one of the few people who sat on a computer everyday, sending out emails and newsletters of things you read. You may not have been able to in the last couple of years, but I still remember and have the links you sent me to read.</p>\n<p>I remember last year when you were in a little better health, and I sat with you, you asked me what I did. The answer I gave you — as I give most people alien to IT — did not satisfy you and you asked for more. The curiosity didn’t leave your face until I explained in detail how we look after servers, how we deal with customers, what I did specifically in my role and how we handled issues if they arose with customers.</p>\n<p>You were the most active man I have ever met, in yours, my parents’ and my own generation; an example of a human being.</p>\n<p>I miss you already. I’m glad you had your children and some of their children around you these last few weeks. And I am glad you are no longer in pain.</p>\n",

It wasn’t without its problems (themes, for a start), but when it came to posting & sharing, Posterous stood out on platform and features. I ran four different blogs on Posterous — what-was-this-blog, food, corporate and more recently, a collection of pictures — and converted a few people to it as well.</p>\n<p>Something I’m yet to see in any other platform is how well Posterous managed sharing. The ability for group blogs to have posts shared to a group account and people’s personal accounts was pretty solid, not to mention Posterous’ autoposting capabilities. For example, I never once manually uploaded a picture to my Flickr in over two years but I have a full photo history there.</p>\n<p>Sadly, their Twitter acquisition has changed all of this.</p>\n\nAs Twitter tends to do, they hired the Posterous team for talent, which is great and I’m really happy for the guys too — I’ve followed some of them and know them to be driven individuals [who care about their products](http://www.chirag.biz/2012/07/07/how-we-ran.html).\n\n<p>But I also know that Posterous will not develop new features for the foreseeable future.

Oddly enough, that decision didn’t take long, but I learnt that the real question was how.</p>\n<p>Wordpress is the only platform that has a Posterous importer that actually works but I had/have no interest in moving there.* I have no inclination to maintain a self-hosted break-fix blog and .com tends to be a little limited with the kind of tweaks I like to have.

I don’t want to even begin to believe that a compact camera can do those shots.</em></p>\n<p><em>I won’t believe it.”</em></p>\n<p>When I first heard about Samsung’s new <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/topic/nx-system\" target=\"_blank\">NX series</a> line, I was a little intrigued. Samsung is not exactly known for its cameras, although that also means that I went in with no expectations.</p>\n<p>When I actually managed to take a few pictures with one, I was surprised. The Samsung NX1000 holds its own when it comes to photography as a compact camera for those wanting the options of inter-changable lenses while still carrying around a more portable device. And before you ask, yes, <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BJPUS\" target=\"_blank\">it does come in pink</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the camera is definitely recommended as a quality 20.3 megapixel camera that takes great shots whether in all-auto (SMART) or various less-auto/manual modes, at a competitive price in its range. The NX1000 does have features such as Wi-Fi, i-Fn and inbuilt filters that those cameras don’t; so it’s a good buy for the photo aficionado that wants something in that price range and quality.</p>\n<p>All other things being the same, I think its worth discussing the three elements that give the camera (well, the series, considering other cameras in the Samsung NX range have them as well) a little edge.</p>\n<h4>Wi-Fi</h4>\n<p>Samsung has incorporated Wi-Fi capabilities into the NX series. This allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload pictures to an offsite storage (currently integrated with SkyDrive)</li>\n<li>Upload pictures to social media (Facebook, Picasa)</li>\n<li>Extract pictures to your smartphone (iPhone, Android)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the share-the-second-I-take-a-picture generation, these are must-haves, although my own use of this during the review period wasn’t excessive. The Skydrive and social media integration are pretty self explanatory. The smartphone option is enabled with a Mobile-Link app for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilelink/id505414479?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsungimaging.filesharing&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> that allows you to connect to the camera as a hotspot, and offload pictures to the phone. This is actually quite nice, since you can edit them a bit if you like, and shuttle them off via social networks or email.</p>\n<p>Setup was rather easy so it wouldn’t be a pain for the non-network-savvy. Just a few clicks, and you’re on your way.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d060b-0usi8grgc0wpp_wbx.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Pulling photos onto a smartphone was a breeze</em></p>\n<h4>i-Fn</h4>\n<p>I used this feature the most out of the three. The Samsung smart lenses have an outer ring that allows you to activate menu controls to select options such as ISO and filters (see below) by rotating the ring rather than clicking the buttons. This made for a seamless experience during shooting without losing your grip, particularly if you want to take the setting to an extreme value.</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>In today’s Instagram age, filters are a smart add-on, no pun intended. The camera comes built in the a variety of smart filters such as vingetting, fish-eye, haftone dots, old film, etc. If I were to use filters, this’d be a better way I’d do it since you can actually position your shot to meet the filter rather than hope it works out in post-processing/uploading.</p>\n<p>Filter selection was easy enough and didn’t take more than a minute to master.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Vingetting Filter with Samsung NX1000\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/16c27-0fk9uxbjtt5it3jzb.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Using inbuilt filters: Dragon Mart, Dubai with Vingetting</em></p>\n<p>Now onto the usual.</p>\n<h4>Build</h4>\n<p>I was happy with the build quality. While the body is plastic, it doesn’t feel cheap and is steady to use even when sitting in a moving vehicle (and no, I don’t mean while also driving!).</p>\n<p>Something was bothering me about the camera as I held it, but it took me more than a day to figure out what it was. I was about to take a macro shot of my favorite photography subject — that’s right, food — and as I brought the camera close to my face, I realized… the NX1000 does not have a viewfinder at all. Your interface with the camera is entirely with 3.0\" LCD screen. This wasn’t tough to get used to but it took me by a little surprise as I’m someone that uses both for photography. That said, I’m sure the lack of a viewfinder helped with the form factor and I imagine most ready shooters will not mind.</p>\n<p>There’s no built in flash, but an external flash is provided. I’m personally not a fan of using a flash in the day-to-day photography I do, so was happy with the decision since I’m sure it helped keep the weight that little bit down.</p>\n<h4>Low light</h4>\n<p>For a compact camera in its range, the NX1000 seems to handle low light shooting rather well. Both twilight shooting and indoor shooting were simple enough to do without too much modification; the auto-ISO settings seem to work well, and I was able to get a decent shot in with the ISO set at 12,800 (max setting). Granted, the picture was a little noisy but it did mean that a lower setting would have worked fine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/4cd3a-025x0gcaohfnl0djk.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Low light indoor shooting looks good too. Hummus!</em></p>\n<h4>Overall</h4>\n<p>With the right amount of manual and effective auto controls, the NX1000 is a good camera for people of any expertise level, and the build is a plus because it’s definitely something you’ll be happy carrying around. I think the NX1000 will compete directly with some entry level DSLRs on price — such as the Canon 550–650D range — and while they don’t exactly fall into the same class of cameras*, it’s a comparison that will happen considering the price point. The NX1000 carries the edge in portability and savvy features such as Wi-Fi and filters, while the DSLR would probably still be more appealing to the traditional photographer with more specific requirements.</p>\n<p>You can see more sample shots in the picture gallery below. As the opening quote suggests, the shots are pro-photographer (and big Canon-fan) approved!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true\" target=\"_blank\">https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true</a></p>\n<p>PS I’m currently looking at the other end of the same range, the NX20, so stayed tuned for a review soon!</p>\n<p>— -<br>*The NX1000 is a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras tend to be more portable and compact compared to their DSLR counterparts, but suffer a bit in action-shot making. At the end of the day, these are two different systems although the price points are starting to line up. If you’re interested, <a href=\"http://www.mirrorless-dslr-guide.com/mirrorless-vs-normal-dslr.html\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> has a good overview of the difference.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On some level, I guess I knew this was just a matter of time. Today <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a>, my favorite desktop Twitter client by some distance, <a href=\"http://blog.twimbow.com/2012/09/12/the-rainbow-vanished/\" target=\"_blank\">called it a day</a>.</p>\n<p>To give you some context, Twimbow did something pretty unique in organizing your social media experience, primarily over Twitter, by allowing you to color code the people you follow, providing a nice visual experience. Ofcourse it was more than just that, their 3-column approach was way better than the one-column-per-item-style most clients follow and so on. More about this in my <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/twimbow-a-social-media-client-with-something\" target=\"_blank\">blog post from last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as they were ready to launch version 2.0 however, the glitches began. I had a chance to speak to a couple of their developers, and learnt that the new Twitter API restrictions were at the bottom of it all, and there were in talks to see if this something that could be relaxed. I don’t want to get into it all here, but the tech world is abuzz with Twitter’s recent changes that directly impact their app ecosystem (LinkedIn, for example, had to <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/twitter-vs-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\">end their Twitter sync option</a>).</p>\n<p>It was, therefore, a matter of time before apps that had built their business model and service around Twitter would start to feel it. Based on my understanding, one of the changes is Twitter basing their API-request cap as a multiplier of the app’s current number of users, which is naturally pretty limiting to smaller startups.</p>\n<p>This is saddening to see. Twimbow was a brilliant client, to the point where I can’t really stand Twitter’s own Web UI, or most of the other clients out there. Even since Twimbow ran into refresh/API-call limitations, my Twitter activity has dropped drastically since I no longer have Twitter open when I’m at my desk. I still use and enjoy <a href=\"http://stone.com/neue/\" target=\"_blank\">Twittelator Neue</a> on the phone, and that’s where most of my tweets come from these days but the future for apps isn’t encouraging.</p>\n<p>All said and done, I hope Twitter knows it shouldn’t be killing the ecosystem altogether. Twitter has systematically bought out providers such as TweetDeck to capture a client in each platform/device category, but it <a href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/29582867630/twitters-api-changes\" target=\"_blank\">doesn’t look like they have the skill and/or capacity to maintain them all</a>. With their new restrictions though, apps will continue to die, and while I know that newer Twitter users just use their Web UI which has gotten more feature rich, it still doesn’t have the experience I’m used to or want and at some point, I fear I’ll tire of forcing myself to get on and look at my timeline.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s just me.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>If you haven’t read about this hack already, take 20 minutes out of your day and read through the article attached below. While the importance of complex passwords, separating your accounts and more can’t be over-stated, there some simple things you should do right away, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable <a href=\"https://www.google.com/settings/security\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication</a> in Gmail so that accessing it requires two items — your password and a one-time code — to make it tougher to get in.</li>\n<li>Facebook has a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&amp;view\" target=\"_blank\">few security settings</a> that you should make use of. Spend a few minutes, clear out unknown sessions and devices, and enable notifications when your account is accessed on an unknown computer/device.</li>\n<li>Don’t ‘daisy chain’ your critical accounts — ie, prevent making two very active accounts the recovery/backup account for each other.</li>\n<li>This one is for everyone that has asked me for this advice over the last 5 years — no, don’t click on a link or open an attachment to something you do not know or understand. If it was really important, the person will find a way to make sure you see it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The article is a worth read to understand sometimes how simple it is to get access to your life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big advocate of the web in terms of function, use and all that pretty stuff. But everything has its cons so let’s not be careless about it.</p>\n<p>To the experts, I say we really need to look at some standardization. The line — <em>‬’[t]he very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification’‪</em> — concerns me deeply.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1eaaa-0jralijfl0bqf533x.jpg\"></figure><blockquote>Meet Mat Honan. He just had his digital life dissolved by hackers. <em>Photo: Ariel Zambelich/Wired. Illustration: Ross Patton/Wired</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>…</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information — a partial credit card number — that Apple used to release information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/40dc9-093y8kfjw6kg3wg4l.png\"></figure><p>Much like I did with Lion, I picked up the Mountain Lion upgrade to Apple’s OS X the day it was available on the Mac App store. <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/lion-first-impressions#more\" target=\"_blank\">I’ve already discussed it before</a>, but this whole download new version of OS while sitting in your room is pretty brilliant. But I’m more amazed when I think of the 3 million downloads at $20. That’s $60 million in sales without a dime in shipping. In 3 days.</p>\n<p>In traditional bullet point style, here goes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10.8 is a <em>massive</em> performance upgrade. Everything just seems to run faster, and there are huge improvements to memory management (I use <a href=\"http://www.rockysandstudio.com/apps/freememory\" target=\"_blank\">Free memory</a> to keep an eye on available memory). But there’s more. The return from sleep is brilliant — seconds over what was normally a 4–5 minute return. The other improvement I’m seeing is when I connect over to an external monitor — the resolution shift/adjustments take seconds now as well.</li>\n<li>I think <a href=\"http://growl.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Growl</a> probably kicked themselves in the foot (paw?) at some point by going paid, but regardless, the notification center is a great add-on. More apps will naturally integrate themselves, which will make it better. It’s great though that Chrome is Notification center-ready already. Twitter is so-so; it’s nice to get alerts but annoying that to reply it takes me to Twitter web, which isn’t a good UX. (No, don’t ask what a chirag sexy cake is).</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/78c32-0zkqqr4-lqjinbu9v.png\"></figure><ul><li>Quirk: Apple has announced that FB integration (at the OS level, and into notification center as well) will come by in the fall. But as I accidentally discovered, the packages are available within Mountain Lion already. Hmm.</li></ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/a63be-0wamfwisgtgzccc6g.png\"></figure><ul>\n<li>Firing up notification center takes some understanding (a quick google explains it though), but there isn’t a hot key with the magic mouse. I haven’t been bothered by this yet but it would have been nice.</li>\n<li>Fonts. I had the same problem with Lion — post the upragde, Chrome’s font rendering went for an absolute toss, and for the font-geek in me, I’m forced to use Safari when I can’t stand it. Let’s hope they fix that quickly.</li>\n<li>I like Safari’s zoom-out tab mode. It’s cool. I’m not sure it’s necessarily too useful though — I’ve never thought of it as a problem to navigate tabs, but it is pretty.</li>\n<li>Icons seem to have gotten a facelift — well, the Retina Macbook Pro is responsible for that, I’m sure. But it’s nice to see crisper, brighter icons around.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/0ec05-0w1tv8ypfvktu-w9p.png\"></figure><ul>\n<li>The return of the Save As.. is a welcome one for most people I’m sure.</li>\n<li>It would seem that I can no longer view the battery life time remaining on the status bar — requiring a click to be able to see this information.</li>\n<li>Freeing up an additional 10GB of space post the upgrade? Sold!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I’m really happy with this upgrade. The performance improvements alone are solid, and notification center is a good answer to a common problem.</p>\n<p>Well there you have it. At least I didn’t do another ‘is Mountain Lion worth $20’ with a cost breakdown post, right?</p>\n",

More so since it comes from someone who doesn’t use a smartphone at all (no, don’t ask). Simply put, the Galaxy Nexus makes for a good looking phone. Like the impression someone at a party in a snazzy black outfit makes, before you speak to him/her, as the case applies. I don’t mean that the phone is bad when you do (or that the person’s a douche, yet), but you can’t know for sure until you have that conversation, can you?</p>\n<p>Since the Galaxy Nexus reached me a few days before the acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/\" target=\"_blank\">Jelly Bean</a> update, we’ll hold off on the OS discussion until the update is done. At first glance however, the phone looks pretty stable. I’m not a fan of the back though — the approach seems a bit flimsy, and reminded me of those <a href=\"http://www.meccano.com/models/starter-bulldozer.html/\" target=\"_blank\">sets I played with as a kid</a>. Unless that was the idea, in which case they did a great job.</p>\n<p>The size of the Galaxy Nexus also takes a bit of getting used to, being larger in comparison to other phones, so this doesn’t seem like a device you can use comfortably with one hand for extended periods of time. But that’s not a real deal-breaker. On the flip side, this display is quite good and the extra screen space makes for better reading.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/70123-0kjxjbfi0dtx0ibtb.jpg\"></figure><p><em>A nice display and a good churning droid.</em></p>\n<p>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to, and so far, typing with one hand requires active use of the auto-suggestions to be quick. The other thing that really got to me though was the position of the sleep and volume buttons that are on the phone’s side (say, in comparison to the top of the iPhone for sleep/wake). This meant I often hit the sleep button accidentally while using the phone, which can take some getting used to. Maybe I’m just holding it wrong.</p>\n<p>If, like me, you live your life in Google’s castle from time to time, initial set up is snappy and the single sign-on with your (multiple like most of us…just me, you say? Okay.) Google account is intuitive. Email, contacts, calendar and browser preferences are sync’d without much fuss, the last once you download Chrome on <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Cream Sandwich</a> (I’m unclear of the logic behind Chrome not being default until Jelly Bean, but my theory is <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/google-io-2012\" target=\"_blank\">Google just doesn’t think like that</a>).</p>\n<p>The Android market — now the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a> — is thriving in its own steam, so apps for most needs are easy to find. The experience over the first day has been positive overall, and the phone does justify its generally good feedback.</p>\n<p>Stand by, a full review with notes on Jelly Bean will be here soon!</p>\n",

No, really, logging into LinkedIn to see a clone of my twitter feed was a little annoying, especially since I knew I was losing out on pure Linkedin content.</p>\n<p>That said, I’m wondering if this will become a downward slide for Twitter and its content/developer partnerships. Reading <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience\" target=\"_blank\">their blogpost</a>, they mention recently enforcing their <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms\" target=\"_blank\">developer rules</a>, which contains clauses like developers shouldn’t deliver a similar experience to what twitter is already providing. While the intention may be right — it would theoretically push developers to get creative about creating twitter clients — it would also start causing problems for businesses who sole product is a Twitter client which mimics the Twitter experience but does it much better (and typically with much needed features).</p>\n<p>One of my favorites — no, wait — my favorite iPhone twitter client is <a href=\"http://stone.com/neue/\" target=\"_blank\">Twittelator Neue</a>. It’s a smooth experience, with my <a href=\"http://eye.chirag.biz/ooh-helvetica-love-my-day-is-complete\" target=\"_blank\">favorite font</a> and awesome previews and conversation views available. But based on the rules, Twitter could say they are delivering a similar experience — with a feed for your Twitter activity, despite the fact that Twitter’s own client is a lot worse (being forced to use Twitter’s RT method is not the only problem I have with it).</p>\n<p>But I’m digressing. The point is that Twitter — in a fairly decent move on some level to protect their brand and experience — might start alienating developers and other networks if they keep this up. I’m sure LinkedIn was not pleased.</p>\n",

(They instead used a Macbook whenever they needed a browser, in case you were wondering).

The photos are only marginally better now, granted, but I shudder at <a href=\"https://naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad-9ce4d2c02c36\" target=\"_blank\">those woeful pictures</a>, ew.</p>\n<p>As I was about to say, throw me a lightly charred pie from a wood-fired brick oven, that cooks in 3 minutes and I’ll be your fan for life. It’s what defines a real pizza for me. I’ll typically take a look at a picture (or the real thing) and almost instinctively decide whether I’ll like the pizza or not. I had searched frantically for a shot when Jamie’s Italian introduced pizzas at their Dubai outlet a few months ago before I agreed to try them out. Speaking of which, I need to blog about that experience soon eventually.</p>\n<p>So it was little surprise that <a href=\"http://foodiva.net/2012/05/a-slice-of-napoli-pizza-in-dubai/\" target=\"_blank\">Foodiva’s post about Rossovivo</a> caught my eye. The review was definitely positive and the pictures got me excited. Could it be, could it? Alas, I had to hold my hopes when the dinner being organized there a few weeks ago was moved after the guest list expanded to a size beyond Rossovivo’s current capacity.</p>\n<p>But let it be known that I pestered incessantly waited patiently until another visit was scheduled last weekend.

Who knew pistachio on a pizza could work?<br><em>Pic 3: The Marinara</em></p>\n<p>The star of the show — for me, anyway — was the Bufalina: Buffalo cheese, tomato, basil. You could taste the difference in the quality of the cheese instantly and, coupled with the crust, it made for the perfect minimalist pizza I enjoy. I jumped at the tomato and garlic Marinara — my mind forgetting that it also meant there was no cheese on it — but the sauce was the right amount of fresh and tangy that I ate it all up anyway.</p>\n<p>The surprise of the show — was the Raffaele: pizza with, wait for it, pistachio! Named after the Chef himself. Frankly I thought it was outright bizarre but I did try a little piece — we all live for bizarre, don’t we? — and I’ll admit the chef gets points for creativity. Pistachio and cheese do seem to go together despite my initial objections, and the women at the table absolutely loved it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02497\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/0793663645.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc02498\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/0f637a83d2.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc02509\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/119e49053e.jpg\"></figure><p>Love the fact that you can watch your pizzas being made at the table.</p>\n<p>So finally, a pizza place I can rave about again.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><em>My initial thoughts with the </em><a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/tablet-pcs/XE700T1A-A01US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Samsung Slate PC Series 7</em></a><em> are available </em><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>What a difference a couple of weeks can make I suppose. As promised during my <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\">initial thoughts</a>, I pushed myself to break routine and use the SlatePC as my primary device over two weeks. Despite the fact that I’m not a traditional Windows fan as such (without getting into it here, the OS just bothers me over time, as any regular Linux or OS X user will tell you), the SlatePC is a good bet, particularly as a work device, with some caveats.</p>\n<p>To start with, it’s the software/OS and not really Samsung that’s the issue here, as I’ve already raised. Windows 7 just does not allow you to really enjoy the SlatePC’s potential. With it, I ran the device almost entirely as a desktop computer, plugged into the dock with an external keyboard/mouse. I was unable to really use the touchscreen — either because my fat fingers couldn’t hit the x in one try ever, or because I kept playing whack-a-mole with the on-screen keyboard. The SlatePC though does come with standard specs you see in today’s laptops, so it did function well in this combination.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/49ee8-0epamj4tpoqdm17sg.jpg\"></figure><p>But that changed when I moved to Windows 8. For those who are ambitious, Samsung has officially <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/\" target=\"_blank\">put up a page dealing with this migration</a> (which I think is smart in and of itself) with drivers for the SlatePC. I did face an issue with the touchscreen not being responsive, but the should-be-patented-process of uninstall driver, resintall driver sorted that out. And the device came alive once the metro layout was in place. Granted, this isn’t a Windows 8 review — which is probably a good idea to put through at some point.</p>\n<p>Win8 also made the hardware seem better than Win7 did. For example, battery life jumped for a barebones 2.5 hours to almost 4–5 hours of use under Win8, which made portability that much better. I’m sure Samsung is already looking at putting together some apps to the Windows 8 Store, which might make development easier compared to builing their own custom ‘home screen’ they have on the Slate for Win7.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/92d7f-0clgtsjwrdfi64k-b.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Much better touch experience with Win8.</em></p>\n<p>So the net verdict: If you’re a Windows user and need a change or are trying of lunging around a 5-kg laptop around with you, with Win8 you should seriously consider this form factor. I’m sure the release of the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/\" target=\"_blank\">Surface</a> by Microsoft is going to add to the disruption, but I find it interesting that Samsung has already put together a device in this form factor that is a great fit for organizations, particularly with travelling employees.</p>\n<p>I realize I’ve said that (professional/work device) a few times, but that’s because at AED4,500, I feel the price point is a bit steep to become an mass regular Joe device. But this price is actually comparable to current business grade laptops that fall in the same range with the same specs. Let’s not forget how much my shoulder thanked me as I carried just this to and from meetings. (With a shoutout to <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2591582&amp;topic=1693469&amp;ctx=topic\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome sync</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a> for making my to-and-fro use of two full fledged devices really easy).</p>\n<p>In the real world though, my co-workers and customers eyed the device intriguingly. One of my customers felt it was a great idea to adopt the SlatePC considering they spend the same on bulkier 14\" laptops that every travelling user they have complains about. And I’ll concede that note taking directly to soft copy made me immensely happy. As did interviewing and marking off CVs directly on screen. No, no screenshots of that are available, sorry.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/10028-0lgomjersgg7iazof.jpg\"></figure><p><em>So I’m geeky. Like you didn’t know.</em></p>\n<p>There you have it. A good piece of hardware, a pretty looking device too and a tricky OS. Win7 might not let you get everything out of the device, but with Win8, there is tremendous potential. I don’t think Samsung really intends this to be a professional device though (purely based on current marketing and the way it’s listed under ‘Home’ on their site), but I do believe that’s where it holds its true potential.</p>\n",

I’m guessing they’ve figured it just makes sense to get out of the business with an inconvenience to a subset of users than fight the growing monopoly that is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook+Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been a user for some time, I’m not an avid user as I tend to just post pictures here instead. However, I thought the least they could have done was to provide a link allowing users to download multiple pics or say 30–50 at a time, which I’m sure wouldn’t have killed their time. Their solution of ‘we’re providing a download link for each individual picture’ is just…annoying.</p>\n<p><em>Update, June 16:</em> While I doubt my blogpost had anything to do with it, Picplz came out a couple of weeks later with a single archive link of all pictures, which they intend to keep available until September 3. Yay.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/d5c81-03vpsupdteoybi5z4.png\"></figure>\n",

				"title": "First Impressions: Samsung Slate PC, Series 7",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><em>Note: I was given a Samsung Slate PC Series 7 review unit this week to play with. Okay, maybe those weren’t their exact words, but how else would I describe it?<br><br>Note 2: I intend to write this as a series of two posts — First Impressions — covering Day 1 with the Slate and an overall review.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/6a063-0ifkbzsjfn1jcqc3b.jpg\"></figure><p>I’m a little confused, actually. I’m not entirely sure where Samsung intended to place the Slate PC Series 7 in a consumer’s lifecycle and I think if they figure that bit out, they’ll have done well.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I don’t think it’s a bad device at all, but I’m unsure how this fits into my laptop+smartphone life. However, it is already clear to me that a comparison of the SlatePC with something like the iPad is not possible — the two do not deal with the same market or have the same goal at all. So I’m going to do my best to keep the iPad away from this discussion. The SlatePC is a PC replacement for someone who wants to be fairly mobile, where you want the full functionality of a PC operating system but the mobility of something like the iPad. So I think this is something that would compete with the Macbook Air for market share.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ea457-0qrmgsxhohrdephe9.jpg\"></figure><p>Staying on point, I can see how the SlatePC would be a good alternative to the PC for someone like me, who moves around, works with wifi where I can, considering it runs a full version of Windows (Win7). At the same time, this is where the problem is. For a devicefocused on having a touch screen, Win7 is extremely cumbersome to use with touch. Thankfully, the device does come with a compact docking station and external bluetooth keyboard (I’ll say it again, thank goodness, the on-screen keyboard in Win7 is pure torture to use with my fat fingers, and using it with the Slate pen feels like a game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole\" target=\"_blank\">whack-a-mole</a>). But this is a software problem.</p>\n<p>Going back to the hardware, the packing is simple and clean. I wish they’d put in a little crevice to unattach the device though — I ended up having to flip the whole thing over to get the Slate PC out. All in all, not a bad looking device on your table by any means.</p>\n<p>But with Win7, the device acts more like a regular PC than a portable device, forcing you to carry around the keyboard/mouse and dock for usability. What’s more, without any data capabilities, you’re reliant on a wifi connection or one of those USB 3G modems, so I didn’t really benefit from having it with me while I was stuck waiting on my EmiratesID appointment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/a08c3-0qng3dbelzcx5hx4j.jpg\"></figure><p>So my first impression is that this is a good device from a hardware standpoint. Powerful, pretty robust, a little awkward sizing compared to other devices in this form factor — but not something that you cannot get used to. However, the software aspect is a major problem with Win7 not being ideal for touch/on the go.</p>\n<p>That said, there is potential if packaged with Win8, where you’d have both aspects — touch and regular PC use — covered and the Slate PC has the hardware to run this — something I hope to test over the next couple weeks, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p><em>Update: Part 2 of this review is available </em><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35211654061/review-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n",

So much so that I did manage to put on a few kilos, but it was much to my delight!</p>\n<p>Pictured here is the ultimate chicken tikka from a traditional Indian roadside eatery- Rajinder da dhaba. The thing about these quintessential dhabas are although you might not like to sit there and eat, you cannot resist the amazing aromas each one carries. Rajinder Singh is known among the Green Park area residents for this scrumptious, succulent and perfectly spiced chicken tikka. Served in a little bowl made of dried leaves, with cool mint and yoghurt chutney on the side, his chicken morsels will melt in your mouth leaving behind an irresistible aftertaste of tandoori spices. Like so many other traditional eateries, this one started out as the eatery for taxi drivers, truckers and assorted transport people.

You can read her post <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/falafel-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: Having known <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com\" target=\"_blank\">Arva</a> couple years now, our manakish discussions have always been interesting. So when I mentioned the falafel manakish a while ago, it just had to be tested. Who cares if it took 8 months to actually make the trip happen. I’m excited then, to bring you a joint foodie post — the first of its kind. Think of it like a special episode.</p>\n<p>Note 2: The word man’ousheh in our post is not some kind of auto-correct defect. It’s the singular of manakish in Arabic. Yes it is. No, it’s not right to say can I have a manakish with cheese. Yes, we know you’ve said it before, we have too. No, it’s never too late to change.</p>\n<p><em>Chirag had told me about these falafel manakish in Karama. That’s like waving a bone in front of a dog, go fetch. I barked till he agreed to take me there.</em></p>\n<p><em>I came across the falafel man’ousheh quite by accident — come to think of it, this is starting to ring true for a lot of really good food I find. The term they first used at </em><strong><em>Moulin D’Or</em></strong><em> when I walked in a few years ago during late night certification classes was: falafel sandwiches. But sandwich it was not. I watched their chef make what looked like a green topping man’ousheh wondering what he was up to, before I realized they really meant ‘falafel man’ousheh.’ I’d had falafel manousheh just once before in Abu Dhabi, where the guy tried to break open what I believe was a solitary falafel over labneh in a combination that, well, was clearly not worth blogging about.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moulin D’Or</strong> however, put a nice spin on a traditional offering, spreading delicious falafel batter on a manousheh dough, topped with tahini, tomatoes, some greens and pickles. I can get aboard that train any day.</p>\n<p><em>Me too…any day, ALL day. And if I’m hopping on any train, I’m taking both Chirag and </em><a href=\"http://www.sheban.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sheban</em></a><em> — two outrageously smart, tech-wired entrepreneurs — with me, and making a food tour working session of it. Yeah I know, *everything* these days is about the food tours. I’ll launch it and then I’ll shut up already. Or maybe you’ll see promo SMS spam on food tours violently possess your cellphones. You can turn off the TV, turn off the radio, shut your eyes tight when you pass an annoying yellow bakeshop-plastered billboard, but cellphone…that’s where I’ve got you *right* where I want you, because Dubai has established that your cellphone is the one place you can never opt out of promo spam. It’s the Hotel California of ominous marketing spam, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave…</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3186-fatayer\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/3591b3991c.jpg\"></figure><p><em>But I will admit, when I stepped into Moulin D’Or, the food tours were the last thing on my mind. For someone whose Achilles heel lies in warm buttery baked goodies, this was heavenly hell. I walked in and it all just smacked me in the face: giant croissants puffed up like angry birds, small white discs of pastry smattered with za’atar and cheese, chocolate glazed rows of ganache and coffee buttercream-layered Opera cake, boats and crescents and all the usual shapes of tiny fatayer with cheese and meat and veggies. How had I not ever given Moulin D’Or a second glance on my visits across the street to Al Reef Bakery? Imagine, all those mornings where I could have been living the dream with HULK buttery croissants…</em></p>\n<p>Seriously? You know you can get giant croissants anywhere right? It’s the falafel man’ousheh that’s a rare species around here. And to think we almost missed it that evening. When I walked up to <strong>Moulin D’Or</strong>’s manakish oven, my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t see the A4 printed sign in Calibri that used to read “Falafel Sandwich, 5 Dhs”. It would seem we were a couple months too late to make the trip, and the falafel man’ousheh had now morphed into a mainstream falafel sandwich, no frills. Dejected, we walked back to the table. I was devastated, Sheban looked sad but could potentially be won over with a meaty fatayer, but Arva? Arva hadn’t really accepted the tragic news at all. She just strolled right back to the counter, because one more attempt at sighting the falafel manousheh was *absolutely* necessary. Skipping over a comment relating to women, better service and the GCC, I will merely point out that the chef agreed to make a couple of manakish just for us.</p>\n<p><em>I’m ashamed to admit that I do use my chubby womanly charm when it comes to food. That’s not a bad thing now, is it?</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3169-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/ee3456b8a2.jpg\"></figure><p>Considering how the evening had progressed, the manakish’s arrival to the table was that much more exciting. The consensus around the table was that it looked even better than expected <em>(though I was just gobsmacked with hunger by this point to have any expectations at all).</em> I was just glad our trip had not been in vain. Crisp manousheh dough, layered with awesome falafel mix, topped with tahina and <strong>crunch…</strong>a quiet calm engulfed the table as we ate <em>(save for my incessant questions about food tours this and food tours that)</em>. Falafel makes for a very light man’ousheh when not fried, and although I felt that my memory of the manousheh I’d had here years ago was slightly better than the reality on my plate, this was still…</p>\n<p><em>…satisfying. Of all the man’ousheh I’ve tried, the salty-bitter za’atar and </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/danat-al-khaleej-lebanese-fattayer/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cheese ones</em></a><em>, the </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/breakfast-to-breakfast-manakish-dubai/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>meaty sujuk ones</em></a><em>, the </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/mount-lebabnon-lebneh-jam-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>creamy sweet lebneh ones</em></a><em>, I’d say this falafel man’ousheh was the more subtle of the lot. The man’ousheh innards were so light that if you guzzled it down thoughtlessly, you wouldn’t hear the falafel spread murmur fragrantly from the crust. The base was thin and crispy, disintegrating into a crunch reminiscent of a stroll over dry autumn leaves in a city with four seasons. There was no cheese, and if there was tahina, it was barely there. The whole ensemble was delicate and understated.</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3184-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/e11d2a6f79.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Cd3174-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/1e66f7043f.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Cd3178-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/4856058702.jpg\"></figure><p>The manakish must have been good, because we talked about falafels for about 20 minutes afterwards. Did you guys know there’s a falafel bar in Sharjah? <em>NaaahsssSSSH! It’s a secret! </em>…but more on that later. I can’t guarantee that <strong>Moulin D’Or</strong> will entertain more requests for the coveted man’ousheh, but having a woman in your party apparently helps. If not, they do have a decent repertoire of manakish to choose from.<em></em></p>\n<p><em>And cheesy fatayer and angry bird croissants. Yumsies.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moulin D’Or</strong></p>\n<p>Drive past Karama Post Office and you’ll see it on your right (before Options Furniture Building). <br><a href=\"http://www.moulin-dor.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.moulin-dor.com</a> | +9714 3547847</p>\n<p>You can find the cross-posted version on Arva’s blog <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/falafel-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n",

My <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella\" target=\"_blank\">previous experience</a> in the Yas Marina Circuit was actually rather good; but taking your parents along when reviewing food can always be tricky, what with specific food preferences and them having to wait while I snap up pictures of life, the universe and everything.</p>\n<p>Now for those of you who want the answer quickly, Amerigos passed!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09455\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/c4f2794257.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09461\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/9e8690b6ed.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09453\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2543b5ceb0.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09377\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/2153b98c92.jpg\"></figure><p>To begin with, I was happily surprised by the atmosphere and setup. While it is part of the Park Inn by Radisson, Amerigos has a very casual and comfortable decor, a semi-outdoor setting, an indoor sports bar *and* a pool area. With the weather still holding up, the experience was enjoyable — this is a place that works for friends, family, a nice quiet evening or an after-work hours meet and greet.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09401\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/d6470791d2.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09404\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/4209e1159d.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09389\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/e6b753b5d2.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09399\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/09d099ff2f.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09395\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/57f5c24820.jpg\"></figure><p>Food wise, the menu has quite a bit to offer. The menu is modelled more on what I would call Tex-Mex rather than pure Mexican. The guacamole was wonderful and among the freshest I’ve had. The other surprise item — well, surprise because we added it on as an afterthough halfway through the maincourse — were the Fajitas.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09428\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/7375dcffc6.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09426\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/4928691374.jpg\"></figure><p>Trust me, their ‘stir-fry’, for want of a better word was so good, I just kept eating the mix without having the patience to actually roll up the fajitas.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09419\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/cf7e5c1499.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09418\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/03470104a8.jpg\"></figure><p>Overall, the food was on well done &amp; fresh. The chef seems to like keeping things simple — something that works very well for Amerigos.</p>\n<p>We were a bit intrigued by something called <em>Hojaldre de Vegetales</em> which was a puff pastry filled with vegetables and an escabeche sauce. While there was nothing really wrong with it at all, it just didn’t feel very Mexican compared to everything else we had and enjoyed.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09413\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/8061d5ae3e.jpg\"></figure><p>Since I’m sure those of you who got this far will want to know, I’m doing the smart thing and attachingthe dessert menu for your comfort. I went for the lime, mint &amp; rum sorbet since I was looking for something light — and in hindsight, perhaps the rice pudding might have been more traditional option.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09434\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/99f2a927a8.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09436\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/267566fd79.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc09450\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f57ff7b544.jpg\"></figure><p>In the end, it boiled down to the usual two suspects — the food and the atmophere, and Amerigos does really well on both counts. There was a healthy crowd through the evening — people out with family and friends, and football fans enjoying the large screens at the bar. Amerigos makes a great choice if you’re up for a leisurely drive across the Circuit followed by a satisfying meal or if you happen to be in the area.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09465\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/029fe83c14.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>Amerigos Mexican Restaurant &amp; Bar</strong></p>\n<p>Park Inn by Radisson, Yas Island, Abu Dhabi<br>(Just drive down the Yas Island Leisure Drive until you hit the hotel area, Park Inn is the first one on your left)<br>+9712 656 2222</p>\n",

Now that I think about it, I’m surprised it hasn’t more often considering my (borderline crazy) fascination with taking multiple shots of food at restaurants and eateries.</p>\n<p>Right, let’s get the disclaimer out first: I love hummus. Part of my life’s mission involves hunting for decent hummus* — and don’t scoff, enough outlets get it wrong for me to include it in a mission statement. That’s how much I adore this awesome chickpea creation. So when I spotted a little outlet in Barsha named after it, I was intrigued enough.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08836\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/708d927b43.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Foul W Hummus</em> is a fantastic testament to the ‘less is more’ philosophy. With a simple menu comprising three main items — Foul, Hummus &amp; Falafel (and related variations) only, they may only do a few things, but they do them right.</p>\n<p>This is particularly true when it comes to their hummus; the only word that comes to mind is <em>addictive</em>! They seem to have their proportions perfectly right — just enough creaminess and just enough tahini — to always leave us licking the edges of the containers every time we go. They also keep a constantly-on-the-stove container of boiled whole chickpeas to add that perfect warmth into each serving.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08794\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f873191a9c.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08795\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/01b28970b2.jpg\"></figure><p>I’m a regular, as Mahmoud (who mans the entrance and phones) will assure you. Heck, I’ve even got cousins all the way in South America craving their hummus months after their last visit (during which, mind, we made 4 trips to the place in a week). We’re not the only ones either; stop by on a Friday morning and you’ll barely be able to stand in there — which will only make you glad they get their orders done quickly!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08801\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/087af8873e.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08800\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/5aa06d480e.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08809\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/be368d59af.jpg\"></figure><p><em>Foul W Hummus</em> does have other items on their menu — foul and falafels — both of which are good as well. I will admit I’ve had better falafels and foul elsewhere, but theirs is still among the fresher ones available around town. It’s just…their hummus is so enjoyable, the others pale a little in comparison. We’ve also tried their fatteh — which is yummy as well except it dries up quickly, so I don’t recommend getting it unless you’re eating it there, or in the car on your way home. (Edit: A subsequent visit indicated that they’ve solved that problem, so take it away!)</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08805\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/a690d3a73b.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08804\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/7e4110391d.jpg\"></figure><p>To top it all, the staff are incredibly friendly, smiling about in their nice blue tees — to the point where they started posing and pointing at things to make sure I covered it in my picture gallery.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08821\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/0ab0b73a09.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08818\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/dc037b9237.jpg\"></figure><p>Once we were done eating and I was satisfied with the pictures of the place itself, Chef Azizi walked out from the kitchen and insisted on showing us (and taking pictures of) their nerve center as he made falafels at the speed of light, the smile never leaving his face. <strong>A must visit!</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08823\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/8dcdd25931.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08824_2\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/5ea2931a8b.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc08832\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/d817d05a1c.jpg\"></figure><p>*I live to eat.

On my recent trip to Sri Lanka,a certain devilled dish sent my palate up in roars and of course I needed rescuing and well water, juice, bread etc. don’t help at all — at least in my case. So the waiting staff brought me a simply but beautifully plated dish of ‘spiced coconut custard’ or <strong>Watalappan</strong>.</p>\n<p>At first sight, it was a light, spongy textured piece of cake with a caramelized top, garnished with strawberries. On taking a spoonful, the Watalappan just melted in my mouth. Smooth, airy and creamy egg custard, with a rich coconut flavor, doused in nutmeg, cardamom and cinnamon and baked to perfection. The beautiful golden color is mainly attributed to Jaggery, which is used to sweeten, also gives the custard a distinct color and flavor.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of my holiday, trying out Watalappan in different cities in Sri Lanka and I must say that <a href=\"http://www.randholeeresorts.com/content.php?sub=3\" target=\"_blank\">Randholee Resort</a> in Kandy, takes the cherry.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It’s been a little over a month since Steve Jobs passed away, and I’ve toyed with this post since then. As is the case with everyone who knew he was battling cancer, it was expected and yet, it seemed sudden. As I opened up a new tab to apple.com, hoping against hope that it was just a twitter rumor, I was greeted by a page that carried the simple words, “Steve Jobs, 1955–2011.” I spent the rest of the morning watching the news coverage highlighting his life and realized that a person’s legacy is what happens when he passes, the people that are touched by the news, and the impact that has on everything we do.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/0fa44-0soiaepmufhkf1c2i.png\"></figure><p><em>Screenshot from apple.com, taken Oct 7, 2011</em></p>\n<p>My obsession with computers can be traced back to 1988. Although, considering the timeframe, it focused on Bill Gates and Microsoft. I learnt over time, more so in 2002 that my calling was more about the story of Apple. That was the year I ventured into the offices of <a href=\"http://www.thetriangle.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Triangle</a>, and continued to toy with Macs full time until I left in 2005. It was 2008 before I would get my hands on another Apple device, and I finally (happily) moved to an Apple computer in 2010. During the last few years, I’ve looked over the start of the computing era over and over, with movies such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=pirates%20of%20silicon%20valley&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0168122%2F&amp;ei=1iK5Tuf6O4yWhQeIxP3HBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEyrXWehCYAIYhKg4en4t7dRxj2A\" target=\"_blank\">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a> and books such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/iWoz-Computer-Invented-Personal-Co-Founded/dp/0393061434\" target=\"_blank\">iWoz</a>. Now that I managed to get through <a href=\"http://www.stevejobsthebiography.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Steve Jobs</em></a>, I feel in a better place to put down this post.</p>\n<p>I think about the Think Different campaign more so since I heard the Steve Jobs rendition of the ad; there is passion in his voice as he narrates it, because — unlike Dryfus, the narrater of aired advert — he believed and equally, understood the words he spoke. I have played Jobs’ version about once a day since I first heard it, and I encourage anyone who might be interested to play it out (see it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or at the <a href=\"http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Remembering Steve</a> event, starting at 9:45).</p>\n<p>I know that he wasn’t a perfect person but as I’ve grown to understand, and as been stated already — Apple was a company only someone like Steve Jobs could have built. With all his passion. His perfection. His eccentricities. His abrasiveness. With who he was.</p>\n<p>People talk about the flailings of a man that powerful, someone who had a bad side, someone who drove people to madness and had shouting fits with anyone and everyone. As he himself told a former staffer who tried to fight him, “…you have no idea what it’s like to be me.” I get that. I really, really do.</p>\n<p>I think also, that it makes sense to look at what he did right. Of where his ‘reality distortion field’ pushed people to do things they didn’t think possible, whether it was the first Macintosh, or the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone</a>. For someone to tell a supplier that the reason they couldn’t do something was because they didn’t believe they could, and that, if they tried, they’d get it, takes a unique set of guts and he had them. He read people instinctively and he knew how to push them, how to get at them. And how to get the best out of them. And it’s those people, the ones who understood, are the ones who will tell you a story about a man who changed the world.</p>\n<p>Jobs today is credited for being the person behind revolutions in the music industry, smartphones, PC, tablet, animated movies, retail stores … and Apple itself. His story will be told for a while, of the revisions he made to everything, of his second coming — back to Apple, of his belief that hardware and software should be integrated and not fragmented for it to work, for bullying the music industry into submission — and saving them to an extent — and more.</p>\n<p>Even John Scully, the man who ousted Jobs way back when, revealed later on that he believed the Apple Board should have sided with Jobs in that power struggle, and that says a lot. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" target=\"_blank\">Jobs Commencement Address</a> at Standford is considered by many as one of the best; where he cited three approaches that he wanted to pass on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep looking (for what you love), don’t settle</li>\n<li>Death is the single best invention of life, it’s life’s change agent.</li>\n<li>My favorite line in this section was: “Even people who want to get to heaven don’t want to die to get there”</li>\n<li>‘Stay hungry, stay foolish’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, we all strive to make something the Apple of its category, and I think that says a lot. I find it even more interesting — even though he obviously didn’t intend it that way — that his (approved) biography released was completed and released some 10 days prior to his passing away, thereby being perfect, complete, in all the events leading up to it.</p>\n<p>In the end, the best statement to Jobs’ legacy is the line he himself approved in an ad that ran all those years ago, “…<em>the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world…are the ones who do.”</em></p>\n<p>Recommended Reads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/mona-simpsons-eulogy-for-steve-jobs.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">Mona Simpson’s Eulogy for Steve Jobs</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Remembering Steve</a>, Apple event for Steve Jobs held Oct 19, 2011</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs Commencement Address</a>, Standford, 2005</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-was-always-kind-to-me-or-regrets-of-an-asshole/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs was always kind to me (Or, regrets of an asshole)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Pulse the mixture till combined.</li>\n<li>Pour into the cheesecake tin and press down firmly</li>\n<li>Whip a bit of the cream with the Philadelphia to soften and remove any lumps.</li>\n<li>Whip the rest of the cream in a separate bowl with the icing sugar</li>\n<li>Add the softened Philadelphia to whipped cream and mix till just combined</li>\n<li>Pour the combined cream cheese mixture into the cheesecake tin, smoothing down with a spatula or spoon.</li>\n<li>Spread a layer of Nutella over the cream cheese mixture.</li>\n<li>Sprinkle on some roasted chopped hazelnuts</li>\n<li>Add one whole Ferrero Rocher per slice of cheesecake. (usually 8/10 slices)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Top tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are making it in a cheesecake tin, line the tin with baking parchment</li>\n<li>Grease the baking parchment with some butter to make it stick to the inside of the tin</li>\n<li>You can make individual cheesecake pots (see picture above)</li>\n<li>Press the digestive biscuit base down gently with a spoon or fingers if you like getting messy</li>\n<li>Dipping the spoon/spatula in water helps the Nutella layer smooth out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I love making cheesecakes almost as much as I love devouring them. I dare you to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed. Happy Cheesecake making!</p>\n",

Which reminds me, I need to go place my iced tea bottle into the freezer for a quick chill.</p>\n<p>Where was I again? Right, so this afternoon we strolled down to one of my favorite dessert shops, Brunetti. Jumping straight for the usual suspects, their little tiramisu container and some cappuccino, we wandered around to see what else attracted our eye. Their cheesecake looked alright, but sitting smugly next to it was a pear and cheese crumble that we proceeded to…crumble. Good stuff.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00042\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/3a42fe5589.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc00044\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/5a89b332d7.jpg\"></figure><p>We also came across a Bacio.

I tried to read a very italian name (which I will need to go back to Brunetti to get exactly and then update here Te freddo al limone) and was like man, I can’t imagine what that would be…until in little tiny characters I read the words that always get me going: homemade iced-tea with lemon. Voila!</p>\n<p>I’ve got to set up a disclaimer here. When in the US, reading those words were like gold. It meant I was in for a treat. Out here sadly, the words iced tea tend to be abused pretty easily. So despite reading those words, and my general affinity for Brunetti, I expect little until this mammoth glass was deposited on the table.</p>\n<p>The hell was this…?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00047\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/d397f4f2d0.jpg\"></figure><p>Yup, iced tea with a comfortable, convenient and yummy deposit of ice cream.

We quite literally just stared at the thing for a while.</p>\n<p>But this takes the cake, pun not intended. I seem to have found <em>the </em>iced tea. And interestingly, it has nothing to do with the ice cream at all. The tea itself was light, fresh as it could possibly be, with the right amount of mint without being overwhelming. (I realize everyone now thinks I’ve got to be insane to psycho-analyze iced tea, but hey…I yam, what I am.)</p>\n<p>The ice cream itself was good, not too sweet, and somehow didn’t overly melt and ruin anything. Over time, it lightly drizzled itself into the tea without overwhelming it at all and considering most people have their tea with milk anyway, the taste was more than acceptable.</p>\n<p>The iced tea itself runs you to AED24, which is slightly higher than what is normally out there (AED12–20) but it still on par with the general Brunetti value.</p>\n<p>Goodness that was good iced tea.</p>\n<p>Goodness, goodness me.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Brunetti</strong>, +9714 339 8173<br><a href=\"http://www.brunetti.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.brunetti.com.au/</a></p>\n<p>The Dubai Mall (Next to <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/a-trip-to-candyland\" target=\"_blank\">Candylicious</a>, opp. the Dubai Aquarium)</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Famous words from an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryst_with_destiny\" target=\"_blank\">inspiring speech</a>. India celebrates another year of independence, and there’s a lot on my mind.</p>\n<p>Every year on this day, I introspect a little. What does this day really mean to me? The answer is weird. It means a lot — and yet, it somehow means so little. I feel patriotic, I feel inspired, I love the tri-colors fluttering everywhere, I’ve attended the flag hoisted ceremonies organized as far out as Philadelphia. Yet I come up with an empty feeling when I think about what I have done. For my country. At all.</p>\n<p>The thoughts take me broader, farther. I think of the world. Of the crises and of <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html\" target=\"_blank\">the mess</a>. And I re-call <a href=\"http://www.farscape.com/\" target=\"_blank\">my favorite TV show</a> of all time, one that — as it drew to a close — highlighted what it means to be human, not Indian or American or Middle-eastern, or anything else for that matter. What we can achieve as a species, and what <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html\" target=\"_blank\">we are destroying</a>. Of political power, and corruption, racism and hatred and cold war.</p>\n<p>Is this what we are really about? If so, I genuinely don’t feel like being human on those occasions.</p>\n<p>I could go on, but I think I want to focus on what needs to change, rather than what cannot be touched or controlled.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, maybe a couple years, I started to find my call, and interestingly, it lies in technology (and <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com\" target=\"_blank\">food</a>, but that’ll kill my point right now). Over the last few years, I’ve <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/web-apps-the-here-and-now-0\" target=\"_blank\">witnessed</a>, thought about and <a href=\"http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business\" target=\"_blank\">complained</a> about changes in technology, the impact it’s having on our day-to-day lives. I have <a href=\"http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business\" target=\"_blank\">some clear thoughts</a> on what I think technology should be doing, which inturn defines what it shouldn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>\n<p>A lot has changed since the advent of <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> was around way longer, but it was always a closed network — something to help you create a close-by community, or keep in touch with your friends and family. Twitter opened it all up — by giving us access to people we’d never be “friends” with in the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> paradigm but could still interact with without losing the feeling of privacy and control. It became a news feed, a community builder and a conversation starter all in one. In India, this has grown over the last couple of years. Today news channels regularly display opinions collected via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/timesofindia\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> (and even <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TimesofIndia\" target=\"_blank\">facebook</a>). It is starting to bring people together, giving them a voice and channelize support (or opposition).</p>\n<p>I think this will slowly but surely impact governance in India. Sadly, our political system is 64 years old (and not in the good way) and well, rubbish. In India, there is a large group of people who think the political system is pointless to bother with. But there’s a young upcoming group of this generation who is <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/India-Against-Corruption-Dubai-Solidarity-Forum/194856737219541\" target=\"_blank\">going out there</a> to make their point too. It may take a few years, but social media is going to help improve it, and with it, things will change.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\n<p>The broader technology scope is equally interesting. I frankly hate a lot about the status quo, and more importantly, the attitude people have towards technology — especially in the corporate area. I’ve been looked down upon, called an idiot and laughed at purely because one look at me makes people know I’m an Indian IT guy, and then I must be like <a href=\"http://search.dilbert.com/search?p=R&amp;srid=S3%2d4&amp;lbc=dilbert&amp;w=Outsource&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdilbert%2ecom%2fstrips%2fcomic%2f2010%2d02%2d12%2f&amp;rk=1&amp;uid=423127987&amp;sid=2&amp;ts=custom&amp;rsc=33QnUk4JSgg1gJLa&amp;method=and&amp;isort=date&amp;view=list&amp;filter=type%3acomic\" target=\"_blank\">every Indian IT guy</a>. It’s a funny kind of racism.</p>\n<p>I’ve even been told that people are moving away from working with Indians because the cost-reduction does not offset the time and energy required to get Indians up to speed and up to the right level of professional working since we are “so far behind”. Is this what and where we want to be?</p>\n<p>It is time to change that.</p>\n<p>It’s our own damned fault too, and it needs to change with us first. Indians in technology need to stop coming off as bookworms, because we can be so much more. We need to stop rejecting new technologies and fighting over <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/technology/will-india-ban-the-blackberry-43817\" target=\"_blank\">stupid bans</a>, and focus on what we can do to improve the way we do things. Starting with education. And not stopping there. In some arenas, technology is so backward it’s not even laughable. I’ve even had <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/reliance-part-iii-and-im-done\" target=\"_blank\">bad experiences even with the big names</a> and the way they treat us, their customers, fellow Indians.</p>\n<p>This is an open call to any organization in India who wants to change they way they do things, and the way they use technology, and need advice. Heck, I’ll even do as much as I can of it for free. All I ask is you have an open mind to embrace what I have to say and accept that there needs to be a change in attitude. If you don’t like what I have to say after that, no problem. <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/chiragnd\" target=\"_blank\">Tweet</a>, drop me a line on <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragnd\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"http://gplus.to/chiragnd\" target=\"_blank\">Google+</a>, whatever.</p>\n<p>I’ve <a href=\"http://www.cognitoit.com/news/cognito-announces-launch-of-cloud-based-web--email-security-in-india-1570283.html\" target=\"_blank\">started it</a> a little bit too. And while it hasn’t been easy, I will keep trying until technology peers in India — the local, day-to-day folks just as much as the big guns — change their attitude towards technology, operations and most importantly — the way they treat their users, customers and us in general.</p>\n<p>It’s an odd goal, I know, but this is how I can contribute.</p>\n<p>How will you?</p>\n",

Boasting authentic food, the real reason I wanted to try it out was because someone who tried out my <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13\" target=\"_blank\">favorite pizzeria in Dubai</a> (which has since shut down) said he had liked Il Forno better.</p>\n<p>Not one to take criticism poorly, I tried it.</p>\n<p>One bite in and Il Forno fell into the category of just another pizza place. They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. I only tried their pizza — I went with their garlic-and-olive-oil option — and felt mostly like I was eating a couple-hours-old manakish. The crust was overwhelming, didn’t feel too fresh and the cheese was your usual unfrozen mozzarella. The iced tea I had with the pizza was your standard run-of-the-mill restaurant iced tea and not brewed or such either.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc03681_1\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/b76eb96cb4.jpg\"></figure><p>Il Forno works with something that does look like a woodfire oven, although it’s a pretty standard one in reality. The staff were friendly though and while I’ve only tried their pizzas on a couple different occasions, it’s been with the same results.</p>\n<p>For those following closely, the search continues for good pizza in the UAE. There are some <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella\" target=\"_blank\">I like</a>, some I don’t and others I despise (and therefore, haven’t really visited since the start of this blog). But I’ve received some <a href=\"http://foodiva.net/2011/07/dubais-best-pizza-emporio-armani-caffe/\" target=\"_blank\">good suggestions</a> and will post up once I get a chance to try them out. All in all, Il Forno is not going to be my favorite pizza anytime soon.</p>\n<p>— -<br><em>Il Forno Italian Restaurant</em><br>Abu Dhabi Mall, Abu Dhabi &amp; multiple locations</p>\n",

Point is, it was linked to a foodblog (go ahead, click it), but the friend had confused it as being this blog because of “eerily similar[ity] to u!” Another food blog? With much better pictures? Ooh. I <a href=\"http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/\" target=\"_blank\">hastily posted</a> what I can only imagine now was a <a href=\"http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/\" target=\"_blank\">creepy comment</a> and didn’t think anything of it afterward. Who responds to blog comments right? A grand total of 4 minutes later, I received an email titled “Hi — just saw your comment on my blog :)”.</p>\n<p>Today, Famished in Arabia (or FiA) as we were coined, is a group of 56 food bloggers (as of 8 p.m. GMT+4 today) covering various walks of life and blogging about a whole variety of different things — from expert restaurant reviews, expert bakers, expert pickle-makers, expert restaurant owners and.. well there’s me too. The group has seen a phenomenal growth — oh a history buff you say? you want <a href=\"http://www.foodonymph.com/uae-food-bloggers/\" target=\"_blank\">ALL the details</a>? — anyway, the rest of you, like I was saying…</p>\n<p>Today Famished in Arabia celebrates a year of existance. And what a marvelous one at that. Some very creative people, some very talented people and most importantly some very passionate people. This means that as the site grows, the information flowing gets even better — new places worth checking out, suggestions on evening-outings, and even tips on cooking and baking better. Even more, how to photograph food — some of the <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/modak\" target=\"_blank\">improvements</a> (What rubbish you say? You haven’t seen any? Pfft, <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/thepla\" target=\"_blank\">go away</a>!) you see on this blog over the past year have happened because of things I’ve picked up by just admiring all of these blogs.</p>\n<p>Right, so what’s the point of the post you ask? Well it’s to say Happy Birthday FiA. It’s to be happy and proud to see it grow into something great — just think about it, for a country like UAE, to have 56 independent food bloggers each with their own unique voice. That’s amazing. And you know what? I’m actually sure there are more out there, waiting until the silent assassins..er…acquirers at FiA pounce and draw them in with cupcakes…</p>\n<p>I leave you with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F17537357499653494349%2Fbundle%2FFood%20Bloggers%20UAE\" target=\"_blank\">RSS feed aggregate</a> of the food bloggers, and if you’re on twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/chiragnd/famished-in-arabia\" target=\"_blank\">the FiA list</a>.

Come to think of it, I can’t think of anyone who’s ever told me they hate Gummies. Maybe not biggest fans, but don’t like Gummies. Yea, NEVER happens. Gummies are things that you can’t stop eating once you start, then you feel sick and tell yourself, okay not having *that* many again. Until a couple of days later, you walk by a store that sells gummies and…pfft, what’s another entire pack going to do — I survived fine last time!</p>\n<p>I indulged heavily in gummies — gummy bears &amp; worms in particular during my stay in Philadelphia. With everything from the next block grocery store to the elaborate candy stores carry them, they were never in short supply. Over time, you even new which ones carried fresh gummies (yes, there is such a thing as ‘fresh’ gummies compared to stale ones. It matters!).</p>\n<p>Moving back to Dubai meant a literal cut down in the amount of gummy intake. That probably wasn’t a bad thing but you also don’t find gummies around the block, and when you do, they just seem expensive. Ofcourse, all has changed over time and I can safely say I can find gummies within a 10 minute radius from whereever I am these days.</p>\n<p>This however, brings me to <a href=\"http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/life-savers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Lifesavers</a>. For the uninitiated, Lifesavers can be best described as the American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_%28sweet%29\" target=\"_blank\">Polo</a>. Well, you don’t actually get Polo there, and you see Lifesavers everywhere. Frankly they don’t really come close on a taste front, but they make do. What Polo however doesn’t have, are…Lifesavers gummies! Those brilliant, mint-candy-with-a-hole-shaped soft gummies. So good. Case in point: when I touched down in the US last year for the first time in 4 years, the only thing I wanted oh-so-badly along with my Snapple Iced Tea obsession were, yup, the Lifesavers Gummies. And yes, they are joined by the 7–11 Big Gulp.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00012\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/9202ef0444.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc00024\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/34035403f1.jpg\"></figure><p>The good news is, the ENOC petrol station store has started featuring Lifesavers, including the big versions, but in hard candy. Everytime I stop by to fill up the tank — even if more than once a day at the same station — I make a quick move into the store purely to check out the Lifesavers aisle in the sad-puppy-dog-eye hope. So far, I’ve been disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lifesavers, are you listening?</p>\n",

				"title": "First Impressions: Lion (OS X 10.7)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/01412-0vuzimzxkmoh5s-yw.png\"></figure><p>My early thoughts on the all-new Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion — image via <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>), in trademarked bullet-point style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I upgraded to a new OS for all of $30 and did not step out of my room. While this appeals to my height of laziness, you have to say that is an impressive way to function. The installation took about 35 minutes in total, not counting download time (a little over an hour).</li>\n<li>(Update) Case in point, it just took me &gt;30 minutes to download the 30MB new VLC.</li>\n<li>I decided to leave the new scrolling as is and test it for a while first. In a couple of hours, the new scrolling is happening a lot more intuitively. I definitely like how full screen apps are being handled — pretty much a separate virtual desktop that you can scroll in and out of easily.</li>\n<li>I’m having am amazing time using <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> — or I’d imagine any twitter-like application — scrolling through twitter columns is now identical to using an iPhone.</li>\n<li>Mission Control is a brilliant add-on. Actually it’s not so much mission control itself, but the way this has been integrated with the new scrolling and the virtual desktops mode. Very seamless, intuitive to move around and it does what you think it would do. I also like that Dashboard has now setup its own screen on the far left (similar to the search screen on the iOS). It handles dual desktop better than before.</li>\n<li>What remains to be seen is how seamless the change will be between using a Magic Mouse and using the trackpad. At my desk I use an external keyboard and mouse, whereas often during the day or when out, I’m glistening about the trackpad. Now the gestures are a bit different between them for some of the tasks, so it might take more than one try to get it right based on the input device.</li>\n<li>I’m not so sure about the Mail app yet. I’m a active <a href=\"http://www.gmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gmail</a> user for both personal and work, part of the reason is that they offer a significantly improved interface and controls, and the other part is my not having to manage my inbox and archive and so on and so forth — a major pain in Outlook days. Apple seems to have got the interface down real well, I’ll give them that, but I’m not as fast on it as I’d be on <a href=\"http://www.gmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gmail</a>, simply with the shortcuts — I use keyboard almost entirely to sort, shift, search, archive, delete and send email in <a href=\"http://www.gmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gmail</a>. Tab+Space vs Command-Shift-D? Yeaaa, no. That said, the interface is smooth, clean and the use in full screen mode can be very productive and focused. For now I’ll use it on and off, but the lack of labels and keyboard ease of use will deter me as a full-time Mail user. However, I can completely see why normal users (ie, non-heavy-gmail, outlook or previous Mail users) would be very happy with it.</li>\n<li>So far, I’ve not run into an app compatabilities. However, apps that would improve upon the finder, such as say <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a>which adds menu options have lost these, so a re-install will be necessary. At the same time, a variety of my pre-Lion preferences (such as changing my screenshot folder) have stayed on.</li>\n<li>The all new account syncing is actually quite good, although surprising. Using my stored account info the keychain, it managed to figure out that I used 3 chat accounts that also had calendar, contacts and email attached to it, imported the accounts and gave me a prompt to chose what I wanted synchronized. Nifty.</li>\n<li>I also get a feeling that the Dock is on its way out. I was barely using it anyway — a combination of <a href=\"http://www.alfredapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred</a> and Spotlight pretty much give me everything I’d want — but with Launchpad coming on as a visual ‘Let me see all my apps’ option…</li>\n<li>Finder, and just general interface wise, it’s looking a bit more polished. The buttons looks almost Chrome-HTML5 like and snazzier, and there are definitely some adjustments to contrast, shading and general whiteness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s still early days. Still, 1 million downloads on Day 1 is pretty staggering (think $30m revenue and no shipping/box costs). I haven’t tried everything yet, particularly Resume &amp; Versioning.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think I now understand <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>’s Back to the Mac campaign a lot better. They have learnt some sharp lessons from the iOS adoption and incorporated them with good insight into the OS. Launchpad, Scrolling and Full Screen apps are great additions to both experience and productivity — and mission control seems to be a much-upgraded version of Spaces+Dashboard without losing their usefulness. I’m happy so far.</p>\n<p>Be happy to hear your thoughts too!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Well for the two loyal readers this blog actually has, they’ll know <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/as-the-posters-say-it-all-ends\" target=\"_blank\">I got in to the premiere viewing</a> of the final installment of the Harry Potter series. I’ve been a huge fan of the books since I first read them in 2001 and frankly most of the movies tended to disappoint. But that’s normal with adaptations — you lose out on the subtleties, additional plotlines and in the case of Harry Potter, I feel we lost the inherent sarcasm that he spews oh so easily in the books.</p>\n<p>That said, my overall verdict for the final installment is: satisfied.</p>\n<p>As expected, there were a few changes, but I was definitely happy to see a lot of dialogue was imported straight off the books and the intensity was just as captivating. I’m not much of a review writer, but I am very much of a bullet-pointer and therefore, I give you — the bullet-pointed review. Enjoy!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was constantly amused that wand translated to ‘baguette’ in the French subtitles.</li>\n<li>Knowing that Flitwick and Griphook are played by the same person enforced on me that they looked like brothers. TO be fair, he carried out the role real well.</li>\n<li>Bellatrix. Gosh. She does such a good job really, does Helena Carter. Even as Hermoine she’s rather convincing. The character is one of those love to hate</li>\n<li>McGonagal was brilliant. I’m really glad they included the Locomotor spell, with a nice little quip. I wasn’t thrilled they left out her threat to Slughorn to have Slytherin choose an allegiance. The line “we duel to kill” in the book always gave me goosebumps.</li>\n<li>Aberforth was awesome. Loved his character and it was unfortunate he had limited screen time but he had the tone and attitude correct, unlike Gambon’s Albus has been.</li>\n<li>“The boy who lived, come to die.” Brilliant. That entire sequence was perfect.</li>\n<li>Seconds after I thought to myself, where in Merlin’s Beard is Hagrid, he showed up on screen.</li>\n<li>The Battle of Hogwarts lives up to expectation. The scenes, intensity, darkness and the fact that we got to see (again) a lot of the characters in small roles was great. I did miss John Cleese though.</li>\n<li>Caveat (and a little bit of a spoiler). I’ve spoken to a couple who felt that they handled it well but I was not entirely thrilled with the last 15–20 minutes. It wasn’t bad, I just felt it could have been better, although I will say that outside of that, the movie surpassed my expectations. However, for me the end scenes were about the conversations Harry and Voldemort have. I missed that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, I leave you with some thoughts from people sitting around me before the start of the premiere:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I cried at the end of the book wonder what’s going to happen in this movie!”</li>\n<li>And my favorite: “If I haven’t seen part 1 is that okay?”</li>\n</ul>\n",

Theplas are pretty much one of those all-purpose items. A staple for any travelling Gujarati, it can be eaten plain, with condiments such as <a href=\"http://pickleindmiddle.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">indian pickles (achaar</a>), yogurt, garlic paste (one of my favorites) or with curries much like a roti. In fact, the best description of a thepla is probably a flavored roti — you find them in the plain/masala type, the methi (fenugreek), or kothmir (coriander) flavored types. With or without garlic. Adjusted to be soft and foldable or crisp and a little less foldable. Really thin, or slightly thicker. Every family has their own style and the actual recipe is ultimately pretty flexible.</p>\n<p>Enjoy (and if you need some, well, ask nicely :P).</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A lot was said before, during and after. Google+ was unveiled to a lot of trumpets this past week and well, we have a serious well-thought out contender. My first impression — well it still holds — is it looks like the perfect fusion between Twitter — the interactivity, un-binding relationship (You don’t *have* to see my posts just because I want to see yours, and vice-versa), the free-flow of public data and sharing — and Facebook — the limitless posting, pictures, videos and locations. Minus the farmville. In HTML5. Dang.</p>\n<p>I’m not leaving Twitter or Facebook yet. Twitter still holds value for news and initial interactions. The quick easy stuff. Facebook feels like a giant with way too many users to die (which is okay) but I think over time, and what I see from my current troupe of people, will live on for family and company pages.</p>\n<p>A lot has been said already, but I want to highlight some very interesting — and maybe slightly underestimated #wins from Google.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/eb153-0s15d4gbrxtph5e8l.gif\"></figure><p><strong>The Google bar</strong>. For anyone that uses Gmail or Google to search, Google has steadily improved on the bar at the top, making it sleeker, more organized and so on. With the advent of G+, this bar has jumped to a new level. As expected, there’s a new +You option on the left. But: the integration and ease of posting and responding to posts using this bar is absolutely brilliant. Unlike Facebook that requires me to get on its site to view something (or open up an email), Google has setup a way that — quite literally — lets you leave everything as is and respond. I think it’s underestimated how easy they’ve made it. You can write entire posts, respond to any comments all without leaving your search window or Gmail. And it’s slick, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Pushing content to the right people</strong>. This to me is less about privacy and more about sharing. Sharing baby pictures is something I’d do with close friends but not necessarily with the world, pictures from a trip I don’t want extended family in on — the list is endless. It looks like privacy, but it’s more about sharing to the right audience. That’s why the circles ideas work so well. I think it is only a matter of time before I have additional circles around people’s interests, and my interests towards them as part of our group dynamic.</p>\n<p><strong>The one-stop shop</strong>. I don’t really think twitter tried to be this; on the contrary — current issues with development aside — twitter has relied on third parties to build frameworks around the messaging service. Photo-sharing, vid sharing, even link sharing came from outside first. While numbers might indicate a different trend, I do believe most power users prefer twitter clients to twitter web, still. G+ on the other hand is built as a one-stop shop. Over time, I’m sure we will see more platforms and companies integrating with it — pushing and possibly pulling content but the core platform is built for it all. Picture sharing integrated with Picasa, Location with Maps are built so seamlessly it’s tough to see why one needs to go anywhere else. Everyone’s raving about Hangouts as well. It’s a one-stop shop. That will mean a lot to a “new” social network user looking for an easy service to get started on. It will also mean — actually, has already meant — that savvy users are ditching using 2 or 3 services and merging them into one G+ account. There’s value there.</p>\n<p>On a different note, I’m interested to see what value organizations can attach to Google+. From a management side of things. Twitter clients typically allow you to manage more than one account, so that makes it easy enough. FB on the other hand now allows you to act as your organization once you have pages you are an admin of. These options make it easy for organizations to use these platforms. The option to create company-specific Gmail accounts exists for now (since google doesn’t allow Apps uses to G+). I can’t confirm or deny yet how easy they will be to manage. But tell you what, I have an idea. Let’s see.</p>\n<p>UPDATE, July 4: Well, the last paragraph is a tad pointless, according to <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-pages-coming-for-businesses-83985?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed-main\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>UPDATE, July 4, 11:30 a.m.: Guess the google bar isn’t as underestimated. A new Chrome extension keeps the bar floating as you scroll and other improvements. Handy.</p>\n",

Not the Pizza Hut and Dominos nonsense, I’m talking <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13\" target=\"_blank\">real authentic stuff</a>. Light crust that is just a little charred, a good dollop of fresh mozzarella baked to perfection in a wood-fire oven. Frankly in Dubai, I’ve enjoyed that experience in a grand total of <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13\" target=\"_blank\">one location</a>, which has since shut down. But we’ve learnt to move on, haven’t we? Okay maybe not.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06862\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/20485c2fac.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06860\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f5c74f4e11.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06861\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/50bbd442de.jpg\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ferrariworldabudhabi.com%2F&amp;ei=lX0HTrfpF4iGhQe5u-S4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFi2qSEC_ZW_NXYNA4-WiFyRovk8g\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari world</a> hosts a few “authentic” Italian outlets to keep in with the theme. As part of my reconnaissance mission, I walked around the entire place to find out everything I could about the attractions before we decided which ones to hit, I passed by what looked like an absolutely delicious slice of pizza. I ventured in to find a cross between a restaurant and something like a business- or first-class lounge at an airport, really. As I normally do, the first thing I checked out was their oven. A nice little brick deal but with conventional gas flame. Not my ideal kind, but I can live with that.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06867\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/6dc0962363.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06870\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/9fe4254f62.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06868\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f620d398eb.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06865\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/672e59d67c.jpg\"></figure><p>After we were done with our ‘adventure’ on the world’s fastest roller coaster, I dragged everyone in for a slice. I LOVED the mushroom pizza, of which I sadly do not have pictures. Frankly, and I’m pretty vocal about this, I do not like stuff on my pizza. Pizza to me, is defined by the crust, the sauce, the cheese. Finito. Okay one exception — mushrooms. Otherwise it’s just mozzarella and basil. Oh, heaven.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy the extravagant topped pizzas — take the Superbiotic at <a href=\"http://nkdpizza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NKDPizza</a>, they’ve actually done it well, but to me, those don’t fall under the authentic Italian Pizza category. Moving on.</p>\n<p>The Pizza at <a href=\"http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/shopping-and-dining/mamma-rossella.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Mamma Rossella</a> was very well done. The crust was light enough while being a tad crisp and sauce didn’t interfere with the rest. The cheese was just your standard mozzarella (ie, not the fresh kind) but it worked. One caveat is that they make their pizzas frequently and stack them, so they reheat when you pick up a slice (yes, exactly like they would in say, New York) but it was still pretty good.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06871\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f478559a61.jpg\"></figure><p>Before I talk about my problem with this whole scenario, I need to give their Olive Oil a shoutout. Yes, you heard me. Their Olive Oil must have been imported but it was amazing. Fresh, olivey and it tasted like it had been cold pressed an hour or so ago. It was so brilliant I took a picture of the bottle so I can try to hunt it down.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06859\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/63402c62c3.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06880\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/b8f9925292.jpg\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"Dsc06881\" src=\"http://chirag.micro.blog/uploads/2018/9bcdf24981.jpg\"></figure><p>Right, so about the price. This is a bit of a dissapointment. The only way to get a slice is by making an AED243 payment (AED225 to get into Ferrari World and a basic cheese pizza slice is AED18). You basically can’t decide to drive up to Ferrari World just to grab a slice. Which if you know me, is something I would do for a slice of good pizza. The drive, not the pay.</p>\n<p>I was able to find out — sadly — that this was their only branch, and they are negotiating with the big digs at Ferrari World to try and either get the restaurant area accessible without attending the “theme park” or get a mini-restaurant version outside the ticketed area; either of which are good for my purposes anyway. However, they did confirm they won’t be opening anywhere else for the moment, to maintain the exclusivity of being at Ferrari World.</p>\n<p>Mamma Rosella<br>Ferrari World, Abu Dhabi</p>\n",

				"title": "Why @twimbow is my favorite twitter client",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><em>UPDATE, 12 Sep 2012: </em><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35133587524/goodbye-twimbow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twimbow is no longer in active development</em></a><em>, and will be shut down once Twitter’s new APIs take over.</em></p>\n<p>It started with a tweet.</p>\n<p>I’ve been on twitter for some time (two and a half years as I write this) and tried out a few clients pretty early in that span. I rejected the Adobe AIR based apps — I really couldn’t stand the reactivity — and jumped to Seesmic’s Web app the second it was launched. Almost a year ago, I mentioned something about the app when I received a tweet from <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/filos\" target=\"_blank\">@filos</a>, asking if I wanted to try a new app on the block called <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a>. Never one to say no to a new piece of tech, I have been an avid <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> user since.</p>\n<p>The other day I came across a post titled ’<a href=\"http://techcocktail.com/twimbow-the-%E2%80%9Capple%E2%80%9D-of-social-media-dashboards-2011-05\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow: the ‘Apple’ of Social Media Dashboards</a>’ and I think I couldn’t have put it better than that. Having watched Twimbow from version 0.1 to the current 1.1, the client has matured and grown through an innovative approach and a smart expansion strategy.</p>\n<p>To start off, Twimbow looks something like this:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fa701-0kyfgaglek6ap2xxl.png\"></figure><p>I actually wrote out this post twice. The first time, I attempted to list out every feature in <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> that I use and enjoy. Turns out, I use close to 100% of them and this post was too long to publish. So I’m going with another angle: the top 5 reasons why I use <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> over other clients. So here we go:</p>\n<h4>Color</h4>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/f3a71-0cxm7fzep-qlvhkvo.png\"></figure><p>Compared to the traditional dark on white, or white on dark client style, <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> takes an interesting spin, allowing you to assign color to users. Similar to Gmail’s labelling, starting with v1.0, you can assign label names. Considering I follow quite a few users, I’ve created a category for food-related things, another for news feeds and the like and so on. The cool bit is I can show and hide any label as required, so I’ve even created a label (in pink) for users I don’t want to see all the time, for example.</p>\n<p>As a result, when I get online, I can quickly browse and focus on what I want to see by color, either by filtering out others, or even just skimming my timeline. If I’m in a hurry, I only look for colored users that are interesting, vs if I’m on at a more casual hour, when I browse them all.</p>\n<h4>The Solution to the column problem</h4>\n<p>Something that is quite annoying — and outright scary to newer twitter users — is the sheer number of columns generated with some of the other clients. There’s one for @, one for DMs and one for every search I have. If I’ve got multi-accounts, then there’s also one for each account and so on and so forth. <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> works in a 3-column environment and that’s it.</p>\n<p>This is a perfect time to the mention the awesome and every intuitive Personal Buzz column. Everything related to you as a user — your tweets, @ mentions, DMs to and from, RTs by and of you and Favorites are nicely merged into one column. Mind, it’s color coded, so it’s easy to sort through them (or filter one or more out). I prefer the setting that hides my own tweets, DMs I send and RTs I do, simply because I’ve done them and know what they are already. This makes me happy. And always, if I’ve forgotten what someone replied to me, the conversation view sorts that out instantly.</p>\n<p>Gone are the clients that make me feel like I work on Wall Street. Funnily enough, I get really annoyed trying to use them because it just does not feel organized anymore.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Account Support</h4>\n<p>The biggest change that arrived with 1.0 was <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a>’s multi-account support. And boy did they think it through. Each account gets a separate view altogether, meaning you basically switch between your accounts. So far, other clients I have seen merge or have little check boxes to select which accounts to tweet from. Trust me, it’s amazingly easy to make a mistake that way as I’m sure many of you have experienced if you use a corporate and a personal account and such.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a>’s way is simple and importantly — visible — so you don’t goof up accounts ever again. Haven’t made a mistake since. Yet.</p>\n<h4>The Casual vs Power User</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> is a client that all facets of twitter users can enjoy. This means that the more casual users get to enjoy color coding, inbuilt music player and sharing, and even things like inline image previews (for all major image sharing services) and inline reader (to read links posted) so you don’t have to leave the application. Against this, there is something in for the power user too, easy (okay, very easy) list management, and the awesome monitor at the bottom. If you follow a lot of topics, the monitor allows you to save it like a little searchpad (Think Dashboard on the Mac) that you pull up only when there are updates. The monitor has a little status bar at the bottom that populates if any of your searches get new tweets in them. Handy.</p>\n<h4>Responsiveness</h4>\n<p>Out of experience, I’ve learnt the the guys behind <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> — should out to @filos and @marchitos — are very communicative. More importantly, they listen to user complaints or feature suggestions constantly. Over the course of the year, most of my suggestions have been taken into account (or was already in the works), and when they set out a private release of 1.0, I can confirm that they solved every issue I posted. To me, this says two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are passionate about what they are doing. I know for a fact that they are disgrunted users of others twitter apps who set out to create an innovative client that is based on what users like to see. So far, they’ve done a terrific job.</li>\n<li>They care. They’re listening. A simple search of twimbow will show you how often users communicate with them, and how often they write back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could, quite honestly, go on about <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a>. But the best thing about it is that you can see for yourself. <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> is currently in pre-alpha so it runs by invite only. I’ve got a couple to give out, and you can also visit <a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a>, where they showcase users who have invites available. Ofcourse, you can always tweet to them and they’ll put you on the invite list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twimbow.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twimbow</a> has recently set up an office in San Fran. To me, this is exciting, because they are getting serious about keeping this app running. For now, it just supports twitter, but Facebook etc are already in the works.</p>\n<p>Take it for a spin!</p>\n",

I don’t quite like that fruit, I’m more of a berries, raisins, cherries, blackberries, strawberries, sultanas, pomegranates person. Did I mention strawberries?</p>\n<p>So a banoffee pie is primarily made out of bananas, cream, caramel and to give you a kick- chocolate is used as topping. The only trouble I had was finding a jar of ready made caramel. In Dubai, Nestle does not stock it’s very popular Carnation Caramel and I don’t know how to make it at home so I scoured Dubai for ready made caramel, spoke to friends, colleagues, even asked <a href=\"http://www.thequestioncompany.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Question Compan</a>y but in vain. Yes, I tried Marks &amp; Spencer as well but nothing! After days of searching and almost giving up, I *finally* located it at Carrefour in Oasis Center Mall. It was hiding among other jams and ready made spreads.</p>\n<p>There are some recipes that ask for the baking of the crust of the pie etc etc. I found an alternative to that. Here’s the easy recipe:</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n<p>*It really depends how big or small your tart tin is- I used a medium sized one so accordingly, the measurement is as follows:*</p>\n<p>- 1 small pack of Digestive cookies<br>- 3/4th cup of solid butter<br>- 2 ripe bananas (throw in an additional one if you are a banana fan)<br>- 1 jar caramel<br>- 2 cups whipping cream (or heavy cream)<br>- Chocolate, for garnishing- I used Flakes (easy way out)</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>\n<p>- Crush the cookies and mix with the butter. Press them into the base of the tart tin and keep it in the refrigerator for about 20mins or until it is set. It doesn’t take too long.<br> — Spread spoonfuls of caramel onto the base until it is covered (a thin to medium layer of caramel should do just fine). Place it in the fridge for about 45mins to an hour.<br>- Once the caramel has set, cut the banana and top the slices over the biscuit and caramel base. Spread the whipped cream over the banana slices. <br> — Top this with chocolate shavings.</p>\n<p>And you are done!</p>\n<p>P.S. Again- this was the only (blurred) pic I could take before chowing it down</p>\n",

There’s a few new restaurants open there but this one place caught my eye: Chocopologie. Needless to say, the name alone was intriguing enough to get me in there within 5 minutes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/9336b-0euf_ddmnmbiq-pvc.jpg\"></figure><p>After being shown around by a friendly waitress, I promised myself I would go there for brunch since they served all-day breakfast! (How exciting is that?! I love breakfast food!)</p>\n<p>So within the next few days, I was craving for some french toast. I usually make my own but I do get my extra lazy days when I’d prefer to just sit down at a nice place, order it and have it sitting right in front of me just waiting to be wolfed down. Okay, enough ranting now..</p>\n<p>I told my friend Hamna (Twitter Handle: @hamna_), who is a fellow chocolate-eating zombie, about Chocopologie and we decided to have brunch there.

I’ve been to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2023221&amp;id=10506803&amp;l=898d4cd7d9\" target=\"_blank\">Chaddsford Winery</a> in Pennsylvania, USA a few years ago with a full tour so I was looking forward to this, especially since India isn’t really known for producing wine.</p>\n<p>Opening with the fact that India is a “new world” wine country, our tour guide took us around the Sula Vineyard production facility, from the crushers to the fermentation tanks. The process seemed pretty similar to what I remember although this time around the tour guide had to deal with some gruelling questions on the quality of the wine and how it is maintained in India. I don’t think many were really satisfied with his answer, but I’ll tell you this, the vineyard is beautiful to be in.</p>\n<p>While harvesting season is mostly in and around April, we had to deal with empty crushers and no bottling, but the weather on the other hand is probably a lot better this time of the year. After the tour, we stopped by the tasting room and the brownie just had to be tried. Sadly I was a bit disappointed — it was more a chocolate cake than a brownie, and looked way better than it tasted. However the overall atmosphere and feel weren’t dampened much.</p>\n<p>The rest of the team nearby offered to try the house red wine of Sula — the <a href=\"http://sulawines.com/wines/sula-reds/dindori-reserve-shiraz/\" target=\"_blank\">Dindori Shiraz</a> — which the tour guide raved about. I wasn’t fantastically impressed, in the sense, it didn’t give me the “Wow, that is a great wine” feeling, but it was a good wine — smooth and tasted good. There was a hint of berry as promised.</p>\n<p>Overall, you should visit this place once, especially if you are in India. The tour and area seemed quite popular, with people swarming in over the weekend, with tons of little kids, much to our surprise. I’ll tell you this though, it makes a great wedding location.</p>\n",

Of course, there were those moments where I walked impatiently in the kitchen looking into the microwave while it was still on to see if the concoction of flour, eggs, cherries, melted chocolate etc was rising up in each cupcake cover. The cakes, surprisingly turned out to be soft and fluffy. Not to boast, but they literally melted in the mouth. Not sure if cupcakes are supposed to be that way, but who cares! I didn’t go with the conventional icing and instead changed it to a very light version of cherry icing. So there you have it, mission accomplished.</p>\n<p>P.S.

				"content_text": "<p>My e-mail to <a href=\"http://www.rcom.co.in/Rcom/personal/home/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Reliance broadband</a> this morning following my issue. The issue might seem simple, but the principle bothers the hell out of me. I know what it’s like to run a Service Delivery team, with targets and closing times and whatnot. But the deplorable service some (read: many) ISPs take on makes me really wonder.</p>\n<p>Is it because you’re pretty stuck with using them once you sign up that they don’t really have to worry about after-sales support and services?</p>\n<p>This e-mail is only mildly edited from the original to remove personal account information.</p>\n<blockquote>My name is Chirag Desai and we have internet broadband from reliance at our home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On the 8th of November, our modem failed. I filed a complaint number 140684488 with customer care, who told me the problem would be resolved within 24 hours. After waiting almost 48 hours, I called customer care again. I was informed that my complaint had been closed. I told the agent that no one even visited me, nobody fixed anything and I was still without internet. He told me he could not do anything about the previous complaint, and so was forced to open a new complaint, number 140803041 (opened nov. 10) and that the problem would be resolved within 24 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I waited 5 days for someone to call me, follow up or even visit our house. No one did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On the 15th of November, I called customer care again, frustrated that I was without internet for a week. I was told by the agent that my previous complaints had been closed and that the problem was resolved. I told him to please re-open them, but NO ONE HAD VISITED, I WAS STILL WITHOUT INTERNET. I then asked to be transferred to a supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I spoke to team leader Durghesh, based in Mumbai who told me he was extremely sorry for the inconvenience and that he would set up a new complaint (now complaint number 141112992, 15 Nov) and that he would make sure that my problem was resolved and investigate why my complaints had been getting closed without anyone showing up or actually fixing my issue. In the morning I finally received a call from a tech support engineer who told me he would visit. The following day, they replaced my modem (the previous one was completely faulty the engineer informed me).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When I spoke to Durghesh, I asked him how I could go about getting a waiver on my bill because I was without internet for over a week with pure failure on the part of Reliance. He told me that nothing could be done until the bill was generated but definitely I would get a waiver for the lack of internet. I called in after my bill was generated, filed a complaint number 142081510 and was told I would be notified within 72 hours. No one called back, SMS’d me or anything since then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I called again today (Dec. 14) to figure out the status because I did not pay my bill since I expect a resolution to be reached first. I was told by Supervisor Ujvala to e-mail my issues in because my waiver had not been passed because my problem was resolved within 24 hours. This is rubbish.

One of the most popular worldwide topics is food, and here in the UAE, we have our own burgeoning community of food bloggers — people of different ages and nationalities who share an ardent dedication to all things foodie, from tried and tested recipes to local restaurant reviews and essays on memorable gourmet experiences.</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Sally Prosser </strong><a href=\"http://www.mycustardpie.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mycustardpie.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>“I’ve always liked writing, and find my style and rhythm when writing about things I adore: food, eating and cooking for friends and family,” says Sally Prosser, whose blog My Custard Pie offers a peek into the kitchen of a food-loving Dubai family. Prosser cooks attractive, inviting food, and peppers her posts with interesting observations in an open and conversational tone. The blog is updated regularly, with Prosser selecting recipes from her extensive collection of cookbooks, then adjusting them slightly to suit the demands of her family or the produce available in Dubai. She often accompanies the recipes with an anecdote, explaining why she has chosen them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Prosser also has a quest to find “food with good provenance” in the UAE, sharing little nuggets of information about local food developments and detailed information on restaurants (not so much reviews, more descriptions).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Despite saying that she is still pinching herself over the positive response, it’s easy to see why this blog has garnered numerous local and international fans. It is for good reason, after all, that Prosser is regarded as something of a local food guru by her fellow UAE bloggers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Dalia Soubra </strong><a href=\"http://www.daliaskitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>daliaskitchen.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When you are already the co-founder and head baker at a successful bakery (Kitsch Cupcakes), writing a food blog in your spare time shows real passion. Yet Dalia Soubra adds to her site frequently and says she was inspired to start blogging when customers began making requests for her recipes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Now Dalia’s Kitchen, which she describes as her “own little online food journal”, is filled with simple, achievable recipes that have a fresh, modern feel to them. Soubra draws on her Syrian roots and her time spent in New York and Paris for inspiration, and the dishes featured range from healthy dinners to interesting breakfasts, with some seriously indulgent cakes in between. Each recipe is accompanied by a few lines of text and it seems that Soubra is something of a home food stylist; many of the photographs are stunning — clean, appetising shots, with a hint of Donna Hay about them. This blog is well worth a browse, even if you don’t end up making a dish from it (although I suspect you might).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Laila el Baghdadi </strong><a href=\"http://www.lailablogs.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>lailablogs.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Spurred on by the belief that people underestimate Arab food, or simply don’t look beyond the hummus and tabbouleh staples, Laila el Baghdadi started lailablogs.com two years ago. Originally from Pakistan, but born and raised in the UAE, el Baghdadi has a wealth of knowledge to draw on, and her blog features recipes that have been passed down through the generations. The really impressive thing about this blog is its comprehensive nature. El Baghdadi posts pictures of each step of the cooking process, which is very helpful if you are making an unfamiliar dish for the first time. In a nice interactive touch, she also has a “recipe requests” section, which allows readers to suggest dishes that they would like her to experiment with and provide recipes for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>El Baghdadi has big plans for the future of the blog: “I’d like to translate everything into Arabic so that my site is fully bilingual,” she says. “Over time, I’d like to make it possible for users to create a personal profile so that the site can predict their tastes and make recipe suggestions”.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Arva Ahmed I Live in a Frying Pan </strong><a href=\"http://www.foodonymph.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>foodonymph.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The header on this blog reads: “Turning up the heat on my crazy obsession with the world of food” and Ahmed is certainly true to her theme. I Live in a Frying Pan reads like a diary of culinary experiences, featuring tried and tested recipes, restaurant reviews and details of the food sampled on her travels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Having previously lived in New York, Ahmed says the experience opened her eyes to the multitude of ways in which food can be experienced: “not just eating and appreciating it, but reviewing, discussing, describing, debating, visualising, photographing”. As a result, when she moved back to Dubai, she decided a blog was the best way to keep these conversations alive — “to chronicle them over time and share them with others”.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>She seems to have achieved her aim because her personality and dedication shine through. Her detailed posts are fascinating to delve into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Rajani Mani </strong><a href=\"http://www.eatwritethink.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>eatwritethink.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Rajani Mani describes her exclusively vegetarian blog as a means of sharing “food that tells you stories, food that’s handed down by generations of grandmothers, happy food that revolves around conversations and laughter”.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Although it does feature a fair few recipes (from a variety of different cultures), this blog is about far more than that. There are links to food-related articles written by Mani, photo essays and contributions from different culinary enthusiasts currently travelling the globe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The blog has an intimate style: “With the food and the recipes came slices of my life laid out to be picked bare by people I don’t know,” she says. You learn about her reasons for being a vegetarian, or how a certain dish made its way into the family repertoire, and it is precisely these opinionated, personal snippets that make the blog so absorbing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Anja Schwerin </strong><a href=\"http://www.anjasfood4thought.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>anjasfood4thought.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you are in search of interesting, inventive recipes, with the emphasis on health, then Schwerin’s blog, Anja’s Food for Thought, is a great place to visit. Motivated by a desire to eat more healthily, in 2008 the mother of two made a conscious decision to cut refined sugar and flour out of her diet. She began scouting the internet for nutritious, wholesome recipes and was inspired by the food blogs she discovered. With an increased desire to experiment with natural ingredients, Schwerin started her own “personal food journal and cookbook” and began posting recipes and pictures, often experimenting with vegan, vegetarian, low-sugar or raw food.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Her 15 years’ experience as a picture editor are certainly reflected in the quality of her photography; dishes are beautifully presented and many of the photos are striking. She tends to add to the blog two or three recipes a week (estimating that each post takes around two hours, plus cooking time) and says that it is “a hobby that I really love”. The blog has around 10,000 visitors per month, and Schwerin puts its success down to “posting healthy and tasty recipes regularly, together with mouth-watering pictures”. It’s certainly worth browsing through if you want to cook up some restorative, nutritious and unusual fare.</blockquote>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/featured-content/channel-page/lifestyle/the-uaes-best-food-blogs?pageCount=0\" target=\"_blank\">thenational.ae</a></p>\n",

But as is always the case, you want to break the mould.</p>\n<p>What <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">naihar</a> has turned into today is a fantastic collaboration of people who <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/juicy-juicy-mangoes\" target=\"_blank\">love their food</a> — and therefore, people who write <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/is-it-a-bird-is-it-a-plane-no-its-an-ice-crea\" target=\"_blank\">with a passion</a> — which has brought out a unique blend to this blog.</p>\n<p>I can’t seem to put naihar in a category of a <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/restaurant-reveiw-on-the-border-tags-mexican-0\" target=\"_blank\">review blog</a>, an out-and-out <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/chocolate-barfi-kaju-katri-gajar-ka-halwa-pla\" target=\"_blank\">food blog</a> or even a <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/how-to-cure-a-cheesecake-infatuation\" target=\"_blank\">recipe blog</a>. It’s a fun mashup of all three. We’ve covered restaurants in the <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/oh-tiramisu\" target=\"_blank\">US</a>, <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/a-thyme-and-place-for-everything\" target=\"_blank\">UK</a>, <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/wildpeeta\" target=\"_blank\">UAE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/indulging-at-shamiana-taj-lands-end\" target=\"_blank\">India</a> thus far. We’ve <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te\" target=\"_blank\">concocted recipes</a> of our own that <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/mohanthal\" target=\"_blank\">look as amazing as they taste</a>. And we’ve focused on <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/tiramisu-58\" target=\"_blank\">single food items</a> at times not just <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/max-brenner-chocolate-by-the-bald-man\" target=\"_blank\">entire menus</a>, so you know where to <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13\" target=\"_blank\">satisfy</a> <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/rocky-road-chocolate-goodness-marshmallows\" target=\"_blank\">those</a> <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/i-succumbed-to-the-whittard-temptation\" target=\"_blank\">cravings</a> (or <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/molten-goodness-or-not\" target=\"_blank\">where *not* to</a>). Oh, and the <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/the-cake-extravaganza\" target=\"_blank\">cake extravaganza!</a></p>\n<p>What’s up ahead? Well, obviously more coverage of places to eat, things to make and cravings to satisfy. Better pictures. Author profiles. And some interesting changes. We’re working on collaborating with some brilliant foodies out there who could bring an interesting spin to the blog, some food outings and more.</p>\n<p>To our followers, we hope you enjoy what we have in store. If you’ve got a moment, do drop us a comment and let us know if there are things you like (and what you don’t really like) and it’ll help our amazing authors cater their posts a little.</p>\n<p>Finally, a gracious nod to our unrelenting contributors. I’m committing to the one cliche for the post here: Guys, we could NOT have this without you. Keep the food and, almost as importantly, the pictures coming.</p>\n<p>Happy Fooding!</p>\n",

Trying to figure out different ways to make the cheesecake set is an interesting if difficult feat. I trawl through cookbooks religiously on a regular basis, for a little light reading of course, as any aspiring cook would do.</p>\n<p>Though some would bake the humble cheesecake for the new york style, others put gelatine in to set the cream cheese. I have found the perfect alternative, inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/bite-sized-demonstration-strawberry-delights\" target=\"_blank\">bite sized demonstration</a>, using white chocolate in the cream cheese helps it to set firm. Whats more, it actually tastes of that creamy velvety chocolate and adds a new level of richness to the cheesecake, as opposed to the tasteless nature of gelatine or agar agar.</p>\n<p>Whatever the event, try this cheesecake on for size, you will not be disappointed. Different variations of the fruit coulis can be tailored to your own tastes, as per my previous <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te\" target=\"_blank\">mango cheesecake</a>, but remember not to overdo the sugar content. A cheesecake should be sweet and I prefer the coulis a little tart to offset the balance of sweet cream cheese and crunchy nutty biscuits with sharp fresh fruit. Remember folks practice makes perfect, keep experimenting and find the balance that suits you, if mascarpone (which is amazing by the way) is too cheesy for you, stick to Philadelphia. If you would like a baked cheesecake, experiment with the recipe that uses eggs, but always follow these simple rules.</p>\n<p>1. Biscuits: usually a biscuit with a crunch, digestive biscuits, hobnobs, shortbread.</p>\n<p>2. Cream Cheese: Philadelphia, mascarpone, cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese is all fine.</p>\n<p>3. Toppings: I love berries on cheesecakes, and most recipes point you in this direction, but look at the fruit you have in your fruit bowl, I found a mango and tested out my hypotheses; largely being that cheesecakes are amazing with most fruits, as long as you consider the sharpness and sweetness of each fruit on its own and alter the sugar content of your cheesecake to match. Chocolate is also a great topping. Use your imagination.</p>\n<p>4. Have fun. There is no point of being in a kitchen if you are not going to have a little fun, a little drama when the utensils crash and the blenders hum, is what makes the cheesecake or any other dessert turn out beautiful.</p>\n<p>With regards to the title ‘How to cure a cheesecake infatutation’: if any of you ever figure this out, please do not contact me. I like to be blissfully unaware of the fat and calorie content of my cheesecakes, for what is a dessert if not a little indulgence every now and then.</p>\n",

White chocolate clusters. Little bites of heaven. Indulgence at its best. There are no rules, so go crazy. You need good quality White Chocolate, Brazil nuts, (sultanas or raisins if you fancy) and some biscuits. The biscuits need to be crushed, the white chocolate melted, and Brazil nuts chopped. Mix together to form a gooey white chocolaty mess. Spoon into bite-size clusters on baking paper (or as per picture into mini cup cases), leave to cool, and then decorate with milk/dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>It’s a winner every time. Its uncomplicated, fun to try with children, and requires very little effort or fuss. So get chocolaty, I promise you these little bites of heaven are as scrumptious as they look.</p>\n<p>12 oz white chocolate</p>\n<p>10 oz dark/milk chocolate (for decorating)</p>\n<p>7 oz Brazil Nuts (chopped)</p>\n<p>7 oz Biscuits (crushed up)</p>\n<p>note: raisins, sultanas, cereal, sweets, chocolate chips can also be used, be inventive and have fun.</p>\n",

After going through the selection of desserts, I decided to devour a Molten Chocolate Cake (who can say no?)</p>\n<p>Now before you go all how-can-you-commit-a-sin-against-the-holy-grail-of-molten-chocolate-cakes(Chillis to the non enlightened crowd) I merely wanted to try it. Besides, I didnt have much choice a that time of the night. So how was it? Bad.</p>\n<p>Dont get me wrong here. Molten Chocolate cake in my opinion, has to be made in a particular manner- Rich chocolate cake with a soft, liquid chocolate center. Oh, and served hot.</p>\n<p>Naturally when a friendly(sarcastic) waiter asked if I would like my cake heated up, I was taken aback.. But of course it needs to be served hot! Cardinal rule in molten goodness isnt it? So it was popped into a microwave and was merrily swirling around while I made myself comfortable, ready to dive into the warmth of molten chocolate heaven, with rich, moist cake and oozing molten center (yes I was dreaming Chillis here)</p>\n<p>What I ended up getting was lukewarm cake — I admit it was rich and moist and not crumbly — with a HARD center. You read that right, it was not a liquid center, rather like having a bar of chocolate stuck into your cake. I finished the cake bit and left the center. Sigh.</p>\n<p>Apart from bursting my dream sequence bubble, Im sure I could hear a snigger or two from the Chillis.</p>\n<p>Lesson: Never mess with Chillis.</p>\n<p>PS: I was so disappointed, I only took one photo.</p>\n",

I probably couldn’t single out a specific reason, but there’s a lot going on for the place. A nice traditional ambience, really friendly staff and great desserts. Well the food’s good too, but that has to be the case if we’re going to talk about it! A quick mention about the Pope room (pictures of which you can see towards the end). The Pope room is a private seating room that can hold 15–20 people and is decorated with pictures of the Popes through time. It’s even got a nice Pope chair and huge revolving table to pass the food around.</p>\n<p>If you’ve never been there before ??? something they ask you ??? they’ll walk to you to the table via the kitchen, which is a fun part of the experience considering you’re greeted by smiling chefs and waiters as you walk through.??</p>\n<p>Buca is considered a family style restaurant, meaning that ??? contrary to normal places where each person gets their own plate ??? everything is served in huge sharing portions, and comes in 2 “sizes”: for 2, and for 4. Their Caesar Salads are among the best, their garlic bread is amazing and all the food is very fresh. But most of all, I *love* their tiramisu. Just like everything else, this comes in a huge portion that you need at least two die-hard tiramisu fans to finish, but it’s such a delicious and cold blend, it leaves you wanting more, and more. Thank goodness it comes in a size that’s capable of being a one person meal all by itself!</p>\n<p>All in all, my experience was the same as it had been when I last visited the place over three years ago ??? great atmosphere, amazing food &amp; desserts and great company!</p>\n",

That’s right. Chocolate lovers, the time has finally arrived!</p>\n<p>With 100% pure chocolate pipes running throughout the outlet, big drums stirring live chocolate all around and canisters of chocolate all around, the instant smell of pure chocolate hits you as soon as you set foot into Max Brenner.</p>\n<p>You get a 10% discount for correctly guessing the number of times I’ve said the word ‘Chocolate’ in this post, by the way.</p>\n<p>We started off with a milkshake and a hot chocolate. I’m mentioning these in particular because I loved the mugs it came in. The hot chocolate came in a ‘hug mug’ ??? no handles ??? so you literally had to hug it with your hands to drink, which is perfect for hot chocolate! The milkshake arrived in a nice tall glass with Drink Me written all over. What was really cool is the spurts of chocolate all around the glass.</p>\n<p>Overall, the food was quite delicious. Since we went as a group, we attempted a pizza, a burger and a panini. They all came out delicious, and considering their specialty is chocolate, that’s rather amazing. Oh, and that first picture ??? none of us had that, so I’m not really sure what it is. But it looked so good, we snapped it off someone’s plate 0:)</p>\n<p>The money for life, chocolate for the soul box was what they served the bill in. Very nice touch.</p>\n<p>Definitely recommend a visit to anyone that’s in town. And don’t forget to walk around and see their chocolate selection, particularly their chocolate syringes. As Barney Stinson would say, Dee-lightful!</p>\n<p>PS I was kidding about the discount.</p>\n",

You become disheartened and wonder if you should abandon your idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In fact, the existence of competing products is a meaningful signal, but not necessarily a negative one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>…</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1) Almost every good idea has already been built. Sometimes new ideas are just ahead of their time. There were probably 50 companies that tried to do viral video sharing before YouTube.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Other times existing companies simply didn’t execute well. Google and Facebook launched long after their competitors, but executed incredibly well and focused on the right things. When Google launched, other search engines like Yahoo, Excite, and Lycos were focused on becoming multipurpose “portals” and had de-prioritized search (Yahoo even outsourced their search technology).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2) The fact that other entrepreneurs thought the idea was good enough to build can be a positive signal. They probably went through some kind of vetting process like talking to target users and doing some market research. By launching later, you can piggyback off the work they’ve already done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3) That other people tried your idea without success could imply it’s a bad idea or simply that the timing or execution was wrong. Distinguishing between these cases is hard and where you should apply serious thought.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/06/26/competition-is-overrated/\" target=\"_blank\">Good read: competition is overrated by @cdixon</a></p>\n",

To the uninitiated, Reading Terminal Market is best described as a farmer’s market with an awesome hotchpotch of options. True to its style, and enclosed in a just-right closed space within Center City Philadelphia — 12th and Arch to be precise — Reading Terminal offers a wide variety of foods, from baked goods to flowers, meats &amp; seafood to produce and a number of eateries.</p>\n<p>Due to my intense desire to fill as many attractions as I could in my short stay, we hit RTM (sorry, I can’t be expected to type out the entire name each time, and copy-paste stops my smooth flow of typing, but I digress) rather early in the morning, but the place was quite bustling for 8.30 a.m. on a weekday. Since it’s right of Philly’s Market East station, it’s got a perfect location for a quick breakfast, a drop by for lunch during a busy day, or a stopover for supplies to take home at the end of the day. They also offer student discounts on Sundays &amp; Tuesdays, so if you are one, or know one, that’d be the day to go.</p>\n<p>The market is a delight to the retina, and ??I’ve tried to capture as many of the colors as I could.</p>\n<p>We stocked up on some basic supplies comprising organic vegetables, and attempted a place called the Basic Vegetarian Snack Bar for a quick bite. Our reason for picking them — they had every conceivable dish you could think of, from the chili burger to the traditional Philadelphia Cheesestake — but made with organic vegetarian ingredients. The best description on their menu was for the Soy Chicken Salad (paraphrased) — if we didn’t tell you it was soy, you would never know. We have a confession to make — they were 100% right. It was so good, we took a pound of it back home for a later snack. I’ll drop another confession: along with the garlic and olive bread we picked up, this quantity did not last beyond lunchtime.</p>\n",

Well, here we are, you pessimistic person you, our first negative review.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>At the behest of a close friend who had also never tried the place, my first lunch in Philadelphia after three years was at a place creatively called Currito Burrito, right on the??<a href=\"http://www.drexel.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Drexel University</a>??campus by the residence halls. This was housed in a new food court structure that had come up after I left the city. Oh, the excitement.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>Curbing my natural instincts to go to Subway — primarily because Subway in the US kicks Subway in the UAE’s behind by a mile and a half — I went for the “new Burrito place that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Some considerations later, I went for what they called a Mediterranean Burrito, comprising rice, a Black Bean hummus and some other condiments. I wasn’t overtly impressed with the look and feel, or the way he was actually making my burrito at all. And the burrito, right, let me say it was the worst burrito I’ve had, and that graciously includes??<a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/black-bean-burritos\" target=\"_blank\">my own home-made version</a>.??</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>I don’t really know what else to say except to avoid the place, and particularly the Mediterranean option. The burrito was dry, the rice was…is stuffy an appropriate word? And the flavors just did not work.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n",

Needless to say, we all have our favourites, and this is particularly busy haunt for the Asian communities in the North West.</p>\n<p>For starters we ordered a meat feast of mixed grill, which consisted of lamb and chicken kebabs, tandoori chicken, lamb chops. This was accompanied by one of their signature dishes and a particular favourite of mine, as I have made it many a time at home, Thai mango salad. This salad is not as authentically Indian as it is Thai, but nonetheless a great accompaniment to the starters. The salad consisted of a carrots, peppers, onions and mangoes topped of with coriander, and a honey mustard dressing with red chili and pepper.</p>\n<p>For mains we ordered Akbari chicken Masala which was extra hot, far too hot for my liking, but my father loved it; and Lahori ghost which was delicious, the lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices perfectly chosen to compliment this dish. the balance was just right. This was all served with fresh nan bread which was soft and brushed with butter. The new desserts menu was the highlight of my evening, I opted for the Apple tarte, another special on the menu, however it was a big letdown, as fussy me could tell that the apples were pre-prepared and had gone slightly brown. The family ordered traditional Indian falooda (a milk based dessert, with sago, rose water, and dumplings of kulfi ice cream inside it), the chocolate waffle meltdown which was amazing and probably one of the best things on the menu, and a mint parfait which was as standard as prepackaged ice cream desserts can get. The biggest fail on the menu I felt was the lack of locally sourced produce, mainly in the form of Huntley’s Ice cream, whose farm is a mere 1 mile up the road.</p>\n<p>The ambiance was great, with a family oriented atmosphere, to a restaurant which is always busy and very lively of a weekend. If you’re in the North West of England, why not try this countryside gem, nestled in between dairy and sheep farms midway between Preston and Blackburn. It promises to be a find, and will not disappoint.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Picture the scene. Your big corporate meeting, people flying down from Europe for a day. Let’s all meet they said. We insist we have everyone. Schedule for late Thursday afternoon? Super.</p>\n<p>I coordinate with a local contact to attend. Oh, I can’t make it, I have to pick up my kids Thursday afternoon. Right. How about a different time? Yea, that’s fine.</p>\n<p>My battery proceeded to die in the evening. So he called me, and I missed it. Around 10 p.m., when I got around to checking e-mail, I see a “I was expecting a call from you.” There was another e-mail regarding a project our companies were partnering on. I had an issue with it, and it was urgent, so I replied questioning his e-mail.</p>\n<p>His response five minutes later: “I did not hear back from you regarding the meeting.” I replied I did not get a confirmation so I will get back to him on that in morning. And well, you didn’t answer my question.</p>\n<p>I message him after the meeting was confirmed in the morning. He proceeds to call me and say “This is why I was trying to call you yesterday. I can’t make the new time” Eh, what now?!</p>\n<p>Fine, you can’t make it. But what am I supposed to figure out when you say I didn’t hear back from you on the meeting. Instead of typing that, why didn’t you type that you couldn’t make the time. Instead of typing “waiting for your call”, couldn’t you have bloody told me what the problem was so when I did check it, I could react?</p>\n<p>Let me add that 15 minutes after the scheduled time, he called me. When I returned the call, he told me he wanted to know how the meeting had gone. Er. Did you not propose the time that you then cancelled? You *knew* I’d be in the meeting because it was on your damned calendar as well.</p>\n<p>And we wonder why we don’t get a lot of stuff done here. Even though I’m on topic, I will not <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/why-you-shouldnt-bother-with-etisalat\" target=\"_blank\">discuss our favorite telco provider</a> today. But seriously, what is it with simple professionalism around these parts. Why is it so painfully lacking. Inform people what to do, what you want. Communicate! Telling me I’m being transparent with you doesn’t make you that, by the way.</p>\n<p>If I wasn’t leaving out the country for two weeks, I’m fairly certain another post on customer service would be on its way. Until then, make do with this happy excerpt I received the other day:</p>\n<blockquote>Japanese attitude for work:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If someone can do it, you can do it too :)<br>If no one can do it, you must do it!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Arabic version:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If someone can do it, let him do it!<br>If no one can do it, why should I do it?</blockquote>\n<p>And yes, this was forwarded quite graciously by an Arab.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Right, so my post refers to <a href=\"http://www.newzglobe.com/article/20100520/le-magnifake\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>, written about <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=119628084724032\" target=\"_blank\">this event</a>. (see also <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35851147398/arabianbusiness-article-on-the-lemagnifique\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>). It’s fairly obvious from the comments section of the article that I felt rather strongly about the way it was written, because it represented very poor journalism on various grounds. Rather than go point by point on the issues I had with the article (I tried starting the post that way, but boy did it get too long), I’ve decided to approach it from another angle.</p>\n<p>Before I do that, let me start by saying I did not agree at all with the policy in question. Refusing entry — based on clothing, especially if that clothing has cultural or religious significance — to a networking event, isn’t right. I don’t know if the venue should have been different, or something. To be honest, it’s a bit of a double-edged sword: the law attempts to protect the culture and us, as humans, want to be treated equally and not denied entry to networking events.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know them already, allow me to introduce you to the <a href=\"http://www.spj.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Professional Journalists</a>. I’ll let you read on-line what the organization stands for, but I’m going to bring up, in detail, their code of ethics.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Preamble</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Members of the Society of Professional Journalists believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy. The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues. Conscientious journalists from all media and specialties strive to serve the public with thoroughness and honesty. Professional integrity is the cornerstone of a journalist’s credibility. Members of the Society share a dedication to ethical behavior and adopt this code to declare the Society’s principles and standards of practice.</blockquote>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp\" target=\"_blank\">spj.org</a></p>\n<p>It’s straightforward enough. You can argue that it’s a US-based organization, but believe me when I say these code of ethics pass around as a great framework in journalistic circles.</p>\n<p>Let’s delve right in. I’ve highlighted just the pertinent points.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Seek Truth and Report It</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Journalists should be honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information. Journalists should:</blockquote>\n<ul><li>Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible.</li></ul>\n<p>The writer left out the fact that the source in the article actually made it in to the event (after removing her scarf). That changes the feel of the article altogether. The writer states that she did not have that information at the time of writing the article. Eh? She interviewed the source either during the event or after it. The source had already gotten in at the point.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the writer intentionally left out the fact that she herself had been denied entry. Massive whoa, in my opinion.</p>\n<ul><li>Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing.</li></ul>\n<p>She posted the organizer’s twitter post. Yay. She claims she contacted the organizers. I have it from the organizers (and it’s evident from one of the comments) that</p>\n<ol>\n<li>she did not contact them during or after the incident</li>\n<li>they would have let her in to the event had she just contacted them during the event itself since all organizers were available (surprise, surprise)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also know for a fact — I heard this myself on the radio the day before — that the organizers announced they were having issues with the hotel about letting people with kanduras in. It was a hotel policy (and common for this region for a place serving alcohol). People may have missed out on that, but it was her job to verify that this has indeed been announced before she wrote about it.</p>\n<ul><li>Make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.</li></ul>\n<p>I know, I know, the headline could go either way. But to me, the headline questioned the authenticity of the event itself. Well first, that is not under question in the article at all. I was at the event. Two, she never made it in to find out?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examine their own cultural values and avoid imposing those values on others.</li>\n<li>Support the open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m clubbing these two together since they don’t exactly go on the article, but they do go on her responses during the comments. Moving on.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Minimize Harm</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ethical journalists treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect. Journalists should:</blockquote>\n<ul><li>Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.</li></ul>\n<p>No real bearing on the post itself, but you know, I thought I should put that out there. But wait, here’s my favorite part.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Act Independently</strong></blockquote>\n<p>*guffaw*</p>\n<blockquote>Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public’s right to know. Journalists should:</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.</li>\n<li>Remain free of associations and activities that may compromise integrity or damage credibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right, who wants to go first? All through the comments, the writer continued to argue that by a) not mentioning that she had been refused entry and b) sticking to a what happened-quote-response format, there had been no compromise.</p>\n<p>Dear writer, read this about three times first. Now I’ll say it again. By being a victim of the incident, you now have a conflict of interest, and are directly associated with the issue at hand, thereby compromising integrity of the article. This is not a point of discussion. This is a fact. She could not, could not, write the article. Period.</p>\n<p>What’s more, she intentionally left out the part about being refused entry herself. Intentionally. (She says she did so, so that the article could be unbiased. Duh..what now?)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Be Accountable</strong><br>Journalists are accountable to their readers, listeners, viewers and each other. Journalists should:</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify and explain news coverage and invite dialogue with the public over journalistic conduct.</li>\n<li>Encourage the public to voice grievances against the news media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So she allowed us to comment. But she didn’t take it as a dialog. She kept telling everyone there had been no bias, asking us to point out the offending comment in the article. (My gawd woman, you could not write the article itself, at all. How are you not getting this?)</p>\n<ul><li>Admit mistakes and correct them promptly.</li></ul>\n<p>Hah. Yeah. That.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expose unethical practices of journalists and the news media.</li>\n<li>Abide by the same high standards to which they hold others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yea well. I’ve put that up there, but I realize that point one is useless since she can’t see it herself. And that fact makes point two moot.</p>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp\" target=\"_blank\">spj.org</a></p>\n<p>Soon after my comments on the article, I was contacted by one the organizers. Why? Because they were upset that their hard work had been put to shame. More importantly, because they had not even been contacted about their response to the accusations in the article. Or during the event to see if the issue could be resolved.</p>\n<p>It’s a trivial issue you say? Actually, I don’t think so. Sure, the accusations laid on a media company for a networking event are hardly life-endangering. But the core principle is the same — this was pathetic journalism. Arguing that at Oxford (which doesn’t have a journalism program I understand), she was taught that creative writing spices up journalism makes this even more laughable. They’re separate things. I would know. I’ve worked in journalism. I studied creative writing.</p>\n<p>She then turned around to say well, it was an entertainment piece. What? Really? Because it reads like it was meant to be a news article. She said so herself at the start.</p>\n<p>I could really go on and on. No, really. I had at least five additional points in my original blog post. The article was terribly executed, but more importantly, horrendously skewed. I’ve found 12 points of issue with an ethics code for journalists.

It’s quite unfortunate actually that they’ve shut down their branches anywhere except Abu Dhabi. With a menu that boasts a variety of options for every meal of the day, it is a bit of a wonder why they didn’t exactly take off as a concept.</p>\n<p>It also helps that there aren’t too many options in Abu Dhabi, unlike Dubai, where you can stop for a bite or a quick drink and also be able to work. Although for the size of the place, having exactly 2 power outlets is quite a negative point (no pun intended). If you aren’t lucky, you’re stuck without one, which is useless if like me, your laptop battery doesn’t have much of a life. Surely they’ve heard of a multiple outlet??<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector\" target=\"_blank\">surge protector</a>???</p>\n<p>Pictured above is their Egg salad with Spring Onion Mayo sandwich pair.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>What did we learn today? When Etisalat says there’s no problem at their end, you shouldn’t believe them.</p>\n<p>Okay, seriously, where do I begin?</p>\n<p>Let me take you through my day today. At 10:30 a.m. I received a call from a customer of mine telling me they had lost all network access — the IP phones weren’t connecting, they couldn’t receive e-mail, etc. etc. Since no other engineer was available, I visited the site.</p>\n<p>With an interconnectivity between Dubai and Germany and backup operations in Spain, this was a mildly cumbersome task, getting the right people on board to help diagnose the issue. I spent almost two hours trying to diagnose where the issue was coming from and of course, it was from Dubai.</p>\n<p>Since the hardware had been checked already, I decided it was time to do the unthinkable — contact Etisalat. For those who follow this (people do?) and don’t know Etisalat (subtotal: 0.5 people), they’re our sole telecom provider in the UAE. Yes, DU, you’re there too, but honestly, the only thing you compete with are mobile phones. For anything else, we’re not given a choice, and for business requirements, we only have Etisalat. So yea, sole provider.</p>\n<p>So I call Etisalat help, 101, who after running through some transfers, tell me, “Leased Line is a separate department, please call 04 xxx xxxx”. Right cool. In parallel, I might add, I’m trying to reach two separate account managers, both of whom are unreachable (which is okay, that happens).</p>\n<p>So what happens when I call the number?</p>\n<p>Attempt 1: &lt;bad number&gt;<br>Attempt 2: &lt;bad number&gt;<br>Attempt 3: Rings, rings, user busy.<br>Attempt 4: Rings, rings, user busy.<br>I call 101 again.</p>\n<p>“What, that’s not the number, here’s the right number.” There’s 20 minutes I’m not getting back.</p>\n<p>I reach some genius who tries to talk to me like I’m a 5 year old. “Oh dear, you’re having a problem? What is the problem?” Our leased line is friggin’ down, you moron.</p>\n<p>“I’m checking from here and everything is okay. Your problem is definitely in the building. There is no problem from our side.”</p>\n<p>“Are you sure, all the lights are not on, and there’s one red light on the modem.”</p>\n<p>“No, no, here it is showing up.” (In technical terms, that means the link interface is up, ie, there are no problems). “The problem is in your building, someone must have cut the cable or something. Everything is okay upto and including our modem right now.”</p>\n<p>“Sigh, allright.”</p>\n<p>For the next 2 hours I waited for a building technician to show. In about 15 minutes, he traced every cable from the office down to the building telephone rooms and confirmed there were no issues at all.</p>\n<p>I call the Leased Line help back.</p>\n<p>“I’ve verified there is no problem in our cabling. I know there’s no problem in the link in Germany. I’ve confirmed that they’ve paid their bills through the account manager (whom I reached eventually in this hullabaloo). How do I sort this out?”</p>\n<p>“Okay let me check, I’ll call you back.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“You see the modem? What lights show on there.” “4 yellow, 1 red.”</p>\n<p>“Okay, I’m going to reset the port, turn it off and when I say, turn it on again.”</p>\n<p>Pretty much that’s what happens.</p>\n<p>“What lights do you see on.” “4 yellow, 1 red.”</p>\n<p>“When the WAN light came on, did it blink or just stabilize?” “Well, it just stabilized. Why? What should it be?”</p>\n<p>“Oh it shouldn’t stabilize.” (WHAT?!) “Hmm, okay, well it did.”</p>\n<p>“Okay let’s try it again and see if we get a different outcome.” Blimey. “Okay.”</p>\n<p>Repeat performance.</p>\n<p>“What do you see now?” “Oh, WAN link isn’t showing. Red light’s still there though.”</p>\n<p>“Red light? Really. Hmm..” (YA THINK?!)</p>\n<p>After putting me on hold for a bit…</p>\n<p>“I think you have a faulty modem.” You <strong>think</strong>?!</p>\n<p>“I’ll have someone sent over to you with a new modem.”</p>\n<p>Yes, the new modem which arrived at 6 p.m. solved the problem. But nothing changed in the 4 hours since I first mentioned there was a red light. Or that we had a problem. Or…sigh, why do I bother.</p>\n<p>You’d think I’d be done here don’t you? Yea, I’m not. I bring the sequel to my miff with Etisalat: The Twitter Wars.</p>\n<p>So Etisalat recently joined Twitter, with much of the same hullabaloo mentioned earlier. News even filtered in that there were 12 people working the account (12? Gah. At least Dubai doesn’t have to worry about finding creative ways to employ people). Then came a huge furrow of “We’ll get back to you” tweets that didn’t seem to lead very far. And they were tweeting from the web.</p>\n<p>However, when they started using <a href=\"http://www.cotweet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CoTweet</a>, I thought, okay, they’re trying.</p>\n<p>I got a notification saying my year-long subscription for the iPhone was about to expire. Super, I thought. Let’s tweet.</p>\n<p>So I asked Etisalat to help me understand what I needed to do to renew the iPhone subscription, and what plans I had available to me now that I’d completed a year.</p>\n<p>On Apr 22, I received a call from a Sharjah number. I was at dinner and did not see the call. The message left behind was, “Hi I’m somebody incomprehensible calling from Etisalat. I’m following you up on your mail.” Er, what mail? (I realize now that this was related to the tweet).</p>\n<p>I then received this, by DM:</p>\n<p><strong>Apr 23, EtisalatUAE: </strong>Would like to inform we will be unable to renew the current iPhone subscription. Please review our Iphone packages at <a href=\"http://twt.tl/qLQt2GI\" target=\"_blank\">http://twt.tl/qLQt2GI</a></p>\n<p>Uhm. What? Yes, I’m aware that you have some iPhone packages on your Web site. Despite your rather disorienting Web site, I knew what that information was. But does that answer my question? No.</p>\n<p>We will be unable to renew the subscription? What does that mean. Etisalat can’t renew subscriptions? That’s what I asked.</p>\n<p>Response 2:</p>\n<p><strong>Apr 23, EtisalatUAE: </strong>Sorry for any confusion caused. To clarify, this is still the same company phone that you wish to renew, just with a different package?</p>\n<p>Why did you not ask me that question before? I don’t get it. I told them that it was.</p>\n<p>Then I got this:</p>\n<p>Apr 25, <strong>EtisalatUAE: </strong>There may be crossover between my tweets and renewal requests u r sent. Pls bear with me. Am looking into it and will get back to u.</p>\n<p>What is going on, exactly?</p>\n<p>Apr 26, 5 p.m. I received a call from the same Sharjah number to discuss the iPhone dilemma. I’m told that Etisalat does not renew iPhone subscriptions and I just have to move to buying a regular data package.</p>\n<p>One suggestion I received was to just buy a new iPhone and sell it on the market to keep the plan.</p>\n<p>Apr 26, 8 p.m., I got another call from the same Sharjah number to tell me the same thing. I got another call at 8.30 p.m. which I ignored. I got another at 9 p.m. The person wanted to discuss my “mail” about my iPhone subscription, and started telling me how they don’t renew… “I already spoke to someone at 8?” “Oh I’m…” “No, seriously, it’s 9 p.m. and this is the third call for the same info.”</p>\n<p>I hung up.</p>\n<p>All this happened in one day. One bloody day. When I think about the fact that I’ve been a UAE-resident for 20+ years, I don’t think I could even begin to start listing the kind of instances I have been through, let alone people I know.</p>\n<p>Why put it up with it?</p>\n<p>Only, and only because we don’t really have a choice.</p>\n",

Let’s not forget the crispy??nachos to go with them. Oh, and the fajitas, burritos, quesedillas smothered in cheese, beans and sour cream.??Divine.??</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>With??Spanish influences on their??cuisine, Mexican food uses a lot of corn (think nachos), peppers (think jalapeno) and beans in a variety of different ways.

Many of the dishes on the menu can be made into vegetarian options and they aren’t fussy about it.??It’s a must to try their guacamole live. Freshest ingredients, made to perfection live in front of you — it’s a treat for the eyes, and the tongue. Every dish is made with impeccable perfection, served in good time, and for sure you will not end up with??a soggy taco. The drinks and mocktails are refreshing and fruity, and the best for a hot summer’s day.

How awesome can that get? I’m not a fan of cupcakes primarily because of the dollops and dollops of unnecessary icing they put on the actual cake (HEY! I’m entitled to freedom of speech, okay?). The last time I had a cupcake, I had to cut off the 3 inch icing and eat the cake with chocolate bits in it. Happy I was.<br> So anyways, getting back to the ice-cream cupcake. Deeeelicious. The flavor is Oreo Creme Filling. There are layers of ice-cream including chocolate and an extremely thin layer of cake that the ice-cream melts into. All this heavenly goodness is covered in a cupcake shape chocolate coating. Sigh. <br> I couldn’t take a pic of the actual ice-cream cupcake because I was too busy eating it but the one highlighted in red in the above image is what it looks like :) Try it out- they have different flavors.</p>\n",
