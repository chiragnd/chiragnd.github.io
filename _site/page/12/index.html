        <blockquote>..RIM today announced BBM version 7, a free update for the globally popular mobile social network, which will allow customers to make free voice calls to other BBM customers around the world over a Wi-Fi® connection.</blockquote>
<p>BBM is still one of the top two reasons why people still want a BlackBerry, and RIM has just taken that to a new level with native voice support.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, it remains to be seen how carriers respond to this.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>The news continues with Twitter’s new API policies continuing to cut down on Twitter clients. We’ve seen incidents already with <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35559968490/twitter-vs-linkedin" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35133587524/goodbye-twimbow" target="_blank">other clients</a>, and while I do get where Twitter might be coming from, there’s something to be said about the approach they are taking.</p>
<p>In this case, without an existing Win8 client already (and no immediate release date either, even if one is in the works), users will suffer. And by suffer, I mean try to use Twitter web.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/31777-0bkq8xm_f-nh3vvo0.jpg" /></figure>
<h4>Quick Facts</h4>
<p><strong>Brand</strong>: Samsung<br /><strong>Model</strong>: NX1000</p>
<p>20.3MP APS-C Sensor, 8fps, 1/4000 shutter speed, 1080p fullHD video recording</p>
<p><strong>Standard lens</strong>: 20–50mm <br /><strong>Weight</strong>: 0.22kg (without battery+SD card) <br /><strong>Other lens options</strong>: 60mm f/2.8 Macro, 16mm f/2.4 Ultra Wide Pancake, 85mm f/1.4</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BFWUS-specs" target="_blank">Full spec sheet</a></p>
<p><em>Note: I received the Samsung NX1000 camera as a review unit.</em></p>
<p><em>“I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the pics in your gallery. I don’t want to even begin to believe that a compact camera can do those shots.</em></p>
<p><em>I won’t believe it.”</em></p>
<p>When I first heard about Samsung’s new <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/topic/nx-system" target="_blank">NX series</a> line, I was a little intrigued. Samsung is not exactly known for its cameras, although that also means that I went in with no expectations.</p>
<p>When I actually managed to take a few pictures with one, I was surprised. The Samsung NX1000 holds its own when it comes to photography as a compact camera for those wanting the options of inter-changable lenses while still carrying around a more portable device. And before you ask, yes, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BJPUS" target="_blank">it does come in pink</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the camera is definitely recommended as a quality 20.3 megapixel camera that takes great shots whether in all-auto (SMART) or various less-auto/manual modes, at a competitive price in its range. The NX1000 does have features such as Wi-Fi, i-Fn and inbuilt filters that those cameras don’t; so it’s a good buy for the photo aficionado that wants something in that price range and quality.</p>
<p>All other things being the same, I think its worth discussing the three elements that give the camera (well, the series, considering other cameras in the Samsung NX range have them as well) a little edge.</p>
<h4>Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>Samsung has incorporated Wi-Fi capabilities into the NX series. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload pictures to an offsite storage (currently integrated with SkyDrive)</li>
<li>Upload pictures to social media (Facebook, Picasa)</li>
<li>Extract pictures to your smartphone (iPhone, Android)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the share-the-second-I-take-a-picture generation, these are must-haves, although my own use of this during the review period wasn’t excessive. The Skydrive and social media integration are pretty self explanatory. The smartphone option is enabled with a Mobile-Link app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilelink/id505414479?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsungimaging.filesharing&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> that allows you to connect to the camera as a hotspot, and offload pictures to the phone. This is actually quite nice, since you can edit them a bit if you like, and shuttle them off via social networks or email.</p>
<p>Setup was rather easy so it wouldn’t be a pain for the non-network-savvy. Just a few clicks, and you’re on your way.</p>
<figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d060b-0usi8grgc0wpp_wbx.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Pulling photos onto a smartphone was a breeze</em></p>
<h4>i-Fn</h4>
<p>I used this feature the most out of the three. The Samsung smart lenses have an outer ring that allows you to activate menu controls to select options such as ISO and filters (see below) by rotating the ring rather than clicking the buttons. This made for a seamless experience during shooting without losing your grip, particularly if you want to take the setting to an extreme value.</p>
<h4>Filters</h4>
<p>In today’s Instagram age, filters are a smart add-on, no pun intended. The camera comes built in the a variety of smart filters such as vingetting, fish-eye, haftone dots, old film, etc. If I were to use filters, this’d be a better way I’d do it since you can actually position your shot to meet the filter rather than hope it works out in post-processing/uploading.</p>
<p>Filter selection was easy enough and didn’t take more than a minute to master.</p>
<figure><img alt="Vingetting Filter with Samsung NX1000" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/16c27-0fk9uxbjtt5it3jzb.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Using inbuilt filters: Dragon Mart, Dubai with Vingetting</em></p>
<p>Now onto the usual.</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>I was happy with the build quality. While the body is plastic, it doesn’t feel cheap and is steady to use even when sitting in a moving vehicle (and no, I don’t mean while also driving!).</p>
<p>Something was bothering me about the camera as I held it, but it took me more than a day to figure out what it was. I was about to take a macro shot of my favorite photography subject — that’s right, food — and as I brought the camera close to my face, I realized… the NX1000 does not have a viewfinder at all. Your interface with the camera is entirely with 3.0" LCD screen. This wasn’t tough to get used to but it took me by a little surprise as I’m someone that uses both for photography. That said, I’m sure the lack of a viewfinder helped with the form factor and I imagine most ready shooters will not mind.</p>
<p>There’s no built in flash, but an external flash is provided. I’m personally not a fan of using a flash in the day-to-day photography I do, so was happy with the decision since I’m sure it helped keep the weight that little bit down.</p>
<h4>Low light</h4>
<p>For a compact camera in its range, the NX1000 seems to handle low light shooting rather well. Both twilight shooting and indoor shooting were simple enough to do without too much modification; the auto-ISO settings seem to work well, and I was able to get a decent shot in with the ISO set at 12,800 (max setting). Granted, the picture was a little noisy but it did mean that a lower setting would have worked fine.</p>
<figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/4cd3a-025x0gcaohfnl0djk.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Low light indoor shooting looks good too. Hummus!</em></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>With the right amount of manual and effective auto controls, the NX1000 is a good camera for people of any expertise level, and the build is a plus because it’s definitely something you’ll be happy carrying around. I think the NX1000 will compete directly with some entry level DSLRs on price — such as the Canon 550–650D range — and while they don’t exactly fall into the same class of cameras*, it’s a comparison that will happen considering the price point. The NX1000 carries the edge in portability and savvy features such as Wi-Fi and filters, while the DSLR would probably still be more appealing to the traditional photographer with more specific requirements.</p>
<p>You can see more sample shots in the picture gallery below. As the opening quote suggests, the shots are pro-photographer (and big Canon-fan) approved!</p>
<p><a href="https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true" target="_blank">https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true</a></p>
<p>PS I’m currently looking at the other end of the same range, the NX20, so stayed tuned for a review soon!</p>
<p>— -<br />*The NX1000 is a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras tend to be more portable and compact compared to their DSLR counterparts, but suffer a bit in action-shot making. At the end of the day, these are two different systems although the price points are starting to line up. If you’re interested, <a href="http://www.mirrorless-dslr-guide.com/mirrorless-vs-normal-dslr.html" target="_blank">this link</a> has a good overview of the difference.</p>

<p>With my photography skills receiving an update over the last year, and Navratri just wrapping up, I thought it might be a good chance to give the awesome Mohanthal another papparazzi session (here’s <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/mohanthal" target="_blank">last year’s take</a>). Mohanthal continues to be one of the few indian sweets I’m extremely partial to, although I only tend to like the version you see pictured and one that is distributed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambaji" target="_blank">Ambaji</a> when we visit their for prayers. The naihar version is topped graciously with pistachios and flavored with a hint of saffron. Mmm-mm good!</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/09/12/goodbye-twimbow.html">Goodbye, @Twimbow</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>On some level, I guess I knew this was just a matter of time. Today <a href="http://www.twimbow.com/" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>, my favorite desktop Twitter client by some distance, <a href="http://blog.twimbow.com/2012/09/12/the-rainbow-vanished/" target="_blank">called it a day</a>.</p>
<p>To give you some context, Twimbow did something pretty unique in organizing your social media experience, primarily over Twitter, by allowing you to color code the people you follow, providing a nice visual experience. Ofcourse it was more than just that, their 3-column approach was way better than the one-column-per-item-style most clients follow and so on. More about this in my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twimbow-a-social-media-client-with-something" target="_blank">blog post from last year</a>.</p>
<p>Just as they were ready to launch version 2.0 however, the glitches began. I had a chance to speak to a couple of their developers, and learnt that the new Twitter API restrictions were at the bottom of it all, and there were in talks to see if this something that could be relaxed. I don’t want to get into it all here, but the tech world is abuzz with Twitter’s recent changes that directly impact their app ecosystem (LinkedIn, for example, had to <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twitter-vs-linkedin" target="_blank">end their Twitter sync option</a>).</p>
<p>It was, therefore, a matter of time before apps that had built their business model and service around Twitter would start to feel it. Based on my understanding, one of the changes is Twitter basing their API-request cap as a multiplier of the app’s current number of users, which is naturally pretty limiting to smaller startups.</p>
<p>This is saddening to see. Twimbow was a brilliant client, to the point where I can’t really stand Twitter’s own Web UI, or most of the other clients out there. Even since Twimbow ran into refresh/API-call limitations, my Twitter activity has dropped drastically since I no longer have Twitter open when I’m at my desk. I still use and enjoy <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a> on the phone, and that’s where most of my tweets come from these days but the future for apps isn’t encouraging.</p>
<p>All said and done, I hope Twitter knows it shouldn’t be killing the ecosystem altogether. Twitter has systematically bought out providers such as TweetDeck to capture a client in each platform/device category, but it <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/29582867630/twitters-api-changes" target="_blank">doesn’t look like they have the skill and/or capacity to maintain them all</a>. With their new restrictions though, apps will continue to die, and while I know that newer Twitter users just use their Web UI which has gotten more feature rich, it still doesn’t have the experience I’m used to or want and at some point, I fear I’ll tire of forcing myself to get on and look at my timeline.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s just me.</p>

<p>I get a new invite every month, then a reminder that it’s the last day…then that I have it for another month. Plus after my experience with them overcharging me (severely) over an ads offer, I’m just not interested at this point.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/08/08/lessons-to-learn.html">Lessons to learn from Mat Honan’s epic hacking</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>If you haven’t read about this hack already, take 20 minutes out of your day and read through the article attached below. While the importance of complex passwords, separating your accounts and more can’t be over-stated, there some simple things you should do right away, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a> in Gmail so that accessing it requires two items — your password and a one-time code — to make it tougher to get in.</li>
<li>Facebook has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&amp;view" target="_blank">few security settings</a> that you should make use of. Spend a few minutes, clear out unknown sessions and devices, and enable notifications when your account is accessed on an unknown computer/device.</li>
<li>Don’t ‘daisy chain’ your critical accounts — ie, prevent making two very active accounts the recovery/backup account for each other.</li>
<li>This one is for everyone that has asked me for this advice over the last 5 years — no, don’t click on a link or open an attachment to something you do not know or understand. If it was really important, the person will find a way to make sure you see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article is a worth read to understand sometimes how simple it is to get access to your life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big advocate of the web in terms of function, use and all that pretty stuff. But everything has its cons so let’s not be careless about it.</p>
<p>To the experts, I say we really need to look at some standardization. The line — <em>‬’[t]he very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification’‪</em> — concerns me deeply.</p>

<blockquote>Meet Mat Honan. He just had his digital life dissolved by hackers. <em>Photo: Ariel Zambelich/Wired. Illustration: Ross Patton/Wired</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…</blockquote>
<blockquote>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information — a partial credit card number — that Apple used to release information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.</blockquote>

        <h2><a href="/2012/08/01/mountain-lion.html">Mountain Lion</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/40dc9-093y8kfjw6kg3wg4l.png" /></figure>
<p>Much like I did with Lion, I picked up the Mountain Lion upgrade to Apple’s OS X the day it was available on the Mac App store. <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/lion-first-impressions#more" target="_blank">I’ve already discussed it before</a>, but this whole download new version of OS while sitting in your room is pretty brilliant. But I’m more amazed when I think of the 3 million downloads at $20. That’s $60 million in sales without a dime in shipping. In 3 days.</p>
<p>In traditional bullet point style, here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>10.8 is a <em>massive</em> performance upgrade. Everything just seems to run faster, and there are huge improvements to memory management (I use <a href="http://www.rockysandstudio.com/apps/freememory" target="_blank">Free memory</a> to keep an eye on available memory). But there’s more. The return from sleep is brilliant — seconds over what was normally a 4–5 minute return. The other improvement I’m seeing is when I connect over to an external monitor — the resolution shift/adjustments take seconds now as well.</li>
<li>I think <a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a> probably kicked themselves in the foot (paw?) at some point by going paid, but regardless, the notification center is a great add-on. More apps will naturally integrate themselves, which will make it better. It’s great though that Chrome is Notification center-ready already. Twitter is so-so; it’s nice to get alerts but annoying that to reply it takes me to Twitter web, which isn’t a good UX. (No, don’t ask what a chirag sexy cake is).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/78c32-0zkqqr4-lqjinbu9v.png" /></figure>
<ul><li>Quirk: Apple has announced that FB integration (at the OS level, and into notification center as well) will come by in the fall. But as I accidentally discovered, the packages are available within Mountain Lion already. Hmm.</li></ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/a63be-0wamfwisgtgzccc6g.png" /></figure>
<ul>
<li>Firing up notification center takes some understanding (a quick google explains it though), but there isn’t a hot key with the magic mouse. I haven’t been bothered by this yet but it would have been nice.</li>
<li>Fonts. I had the same problem with Lion — post the upragde, Chrome’s font rendering went for an absolute toss, and for the font-geek in me, I’m forced to use Safari when I can’t stand it. Let’s hope they fix that quickly.</li>
<li>I like Safari’s zoom-out tab mode. It’s cool. I’m not sure it’s necessarily too useful though — I’ve never thought of it as a problem to navigate tabs, but it is pretty.</li>
<li>Icons seem to have gotten a facelift — well, the Retina Macbook Pro is responsible for that, I’m sure. But it’s nice to see crisper, brighter icons around.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/0ec05-0w1tv8ypfvktu-w9p.png" /></figure>
<ul>
<li>The return of the Save As.. is a welcome one for most people I’m sure.</li>
<li>It would seem that I can no longer view the battery life time remaining on the status bar — requiring a click to be able to see this information.</li>
<li>Freeing up an additional 10GB of space post the upgrade? Sold!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m really happy with this upgrade. The performance improvements alone are solid, and notification center is a good answer to a common problem.</p>
<p>Well there you have it. At least I didn’t do another ‘is Mountain Lion worth $20’ with a cost breakdown post, right?</p>

<p>For me the fun of traveling is getting to sample the local fast food and other cuisines.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with the term chaat is I northern India’s street fast food. Spicy, a mix of cold and hot, sweet and salty, crispy and chewable the famed street food of Delhi is one not to be missed.

<p>Feast on pani puris, aloo tikki chaat, choley batoore, and so many things that I can’t even possibly mention in this post! Here’s a little sneak peak!</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Note: I was given the Samsung Galaxy Nexus as a review unit.</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/3bedc-0t8enf36i0riujup7.jpg" /></figure>
<p>‘You are so not getting this phone back’.</p>
<p>As far as first impressions go, I doubt it could get much better than that. More so since it comes from someone who doesn’t use a smartphone at all (no, don’t ask). Simply put, the Galaxy Nexus makes for a good looking phone. Like the impression someone at a party in a snazzy black outfit makes, before you speak to him/her, as the case applies. I don’t mean that the phone is bad when you do (or that the person’s a douche, yet), but you can’t know for sure until you have that conversation, can you?</p>
<p>Since the Galaxy Nexus reached me a few days before the acclaimed <a href="http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/" target="_blank">Jelly Bean</a> update, we’ll hold off on the OS discussion until the update is done. At first glance however, the phone looks pretty stable. I’m not a fan of the back though — the approach seems a bit flimsy, and reminded me of those <a href="http://www.meccano.com/models/starter-bulldozer.html/" target="_blank">sets I played with as a kid</a>. Unless that was the idea, in which case they did a great job.</p>
<p>The size of the Galaxy Nexus also takes a bit of getting used to, being larger in comparison to other phones, so this doesn’t seem like a device you can use comfortably with one hand for extended periods of time. But that’s not a real deal-breaker. On the flip side, this display is quite good and the extra screen space makes for better reading.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/70123-0kjxjbfi0dtx0ibtb.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>A nice display and a good churning droid.</em></p>
<p>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to, and so far, typing with one hand requires active use of the auto-suggestions to be quick. The other thing that really got to me though was the position of the sleep and volume buttons that are on the phone’s side (say, in comparison to the top of the iPhone for sleep/wake). This meant I often hit the sleep button accidentally while using the phone, which can take some getting used to. Maybe I’m just holding it wrong.</p>
<p>If, like me, you live your life in Google’s castle from time to time, initial set up is snappy and the single sign-on with your (multiple like most of us…just me, you say? Okay.) Google account is intuitive. Email, contacts, calendar and browser preferences are sync’d without much fuss, the last once you download Chrome on <a href="http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/" target="_blank">Ice Cream Sandwich</a> (I’m unclear of the logic behind Chrome not being default until Jelly Bean, but my theory is <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/google-io-2012" target="_blank">Google just doesn’t think like that</a>).</p>
<p>The Android market — now the <a href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> — is thriving in its own steam, so apps for most needs are easy to find. The experience over the first day has been positive overall, and the phone does justify its generally good feedback.</p>
<p>Stand by, a full review with notes on Jelly Bean will be here soon!</p>
