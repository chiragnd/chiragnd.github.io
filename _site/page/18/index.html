        <blockquote>Emily Shardlow</blockquote>
<blockquote>Last Updated: Dec 1, 2010</blockquote>
<figure><img alt="Ad20101201332749-3-i_live_in_the_f" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/ba180-0akcsqvzjeionbdyj.jpg" /></figure>
<blockquote><strong>Select a subject, and you can pretty much guarantee that someone, somewhere, is blogging about it. One of the most popular worldwide topics is food, and here in the UAE, we have our own burgeoning community of food bloggers — people of different ages and nationalities who share an ardent dedication to all things foodie, from tried and tested recipes to local restaurant reviews and essays on memorable gourmet experiences.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Sally Prosser </strong><a href="http://www.mycustardpie.com" target="_blank"><strong>mycustardpie.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’ve always liked writing, and find my style and rhythm when writing about things I adore: food, eating and cooking for friends and family,” says Sally Prosser, whose blog My Custard Pie offers a peek into the kitchen of a food-loving Dubai family. Prosser cooks attractive, inviting food, and peppers her posts with interesting observations in an open and conversational tone. The blog is updated regularly, with Prosser selecting recipes from her extensive collection of cookbooks, then adjusting them slightly to suit the demands of her family or the produce available in Dubai. She often accompanies the recipes with an anecdote, explaining why she has chosen them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Prosser also has a quest to find “food with good provenance” in the UAE, sharing little nuggets of information about local food developments and detailed information on restaurants (not so much reviews, more descriptions).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Despite saying that she is still pinching herself over the positive response, it’s easy to see why this blog has garnered numerous local and international fans. It is for good reason, after all, that Prosser is regarded as something of a local food guru by her fellow UAE bloggers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Dalia Soubra </strong><a href="http://www.daliaskitchen.com" target="_blank"><strong>daliaskitchen.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you are already the co-founder and head baker at a successful bakery (Kitsch Cupcakes), writing a food blog in your spare time shows real passion. Yet Dalia Soubra adds to her site frequently and says she was inspired to start blogging when customers began making requests for her recipes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now Dalia’s Kitchen, which she describes as her “own little online food journal”, is filled with simple, achievable recipes that have a fresh, modern feel to them. Soubra draws on her Syrian roots and her time spent in New York and Paris for inspiration, and the dishes featured range from healthy dinners to interesting breakfasts, with some seriously indulgent cakes in between. Each recipe is accompanied by a few lines of text and it seems that Soubra is something of a home food stylist; many of the photographs are stunning — clean, appetising shots, with a hint of Donna Hay about them. This blog is well worth a browse, even if you don’t end up making a dish from it (although I suspect you might).</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Laila el Baghdadi </strong><a href="http://www.lailablogs.com" target="_blank"><strong>lailablogs.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Spurred on by the belief that people underestimate Arab food, or simply don’t look beyond the hummus and tabbouleh staples, Laila el Baghdadi started lailablogs.com two years ago. Originally from Pakistan, but born and raised in the UAE, el Baghdadi has a wealth of knowledge to draw on, and her blog features recipes that have been passed down through the generations. The really impressive thing about this blog is its comprehensive nature. El Baghdadi posts pictures of each step of the cooking process, which is very helpful if you are making an unfamiliar dish for the first time. In a nice interactive touch, she also has a “recipe requests” section, which allows readers to suggest dishes that they would like her to experiment with and provide recipes for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>El Baghdadi has big plans for the future of the blog: “I’d like to translate everything into Arabic so that my site is fully bilingual,” she says. “Over time, I’d like to make it possible for users to create a personal profile so that the site can predict their tastes and make recipe suggestions”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Arva Ahmed I Live in a Frying Pan </strong><a href="http://www.foodonymph.com" target="_blank"><strong>foodonymph.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The header on this blog reads: “Turning up the heat on my crazy obsession with the world of food” and Ahmed is certainly true to her theme. I Live in a Frying Pan reads like a diary of culinary experiences, featuring tried and tested recipes, restaurant reviews and details of the food sampled on her travels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Having previously lived in New York, Ahmed says the experience opened her eyes to the multitude of ways in which food can be experienced: “not just eating and appreciating it, but reviewing, discussing, describing, debating, visualising, photographing”. As a result, when she moved back to Dubai, she decided a blog was the best way to keep these conversations alive — “to chronicle them over time and share them with others”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>She seems to have achieved her aim because her personality and dedication shine through. Her detailed posts are fascinating to delve into.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Rajani Mani </strong><a href="http://www.eatwritethink.com" target="_blank"><strong>eatwritethink.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Rajani Mani describes her exclusively vegetarian blog as a means of sharing “food that tells you stories, food that’s handed down by generations of grandmothers, happy food that revolves around conversations and laughter”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Although it does feature a fair few recipes (from a variety of different cultures), this blog is about far more than that. There are links to food-related articles written by Mani, photo essays and contributions from different culinary enthusiasts currently travelling the globe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The blog has an intimate style: “With the food and the recipes came slices of my life laid out to be picked bare by people I don’t know,” she says. You learn about her reasons for being a vegetarian, or how a certain dish made its way into the family repertoire, and it is precisely these opinionated, personal snippets that make the blog so absorbing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Anja Schwerin </strong><a href="http://www.anjasfood4thought.com" target="_blank"><strong>anjasfood4thought.com</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you are in search of interesting, inventive recipes, with the emphasis on health, then Schwerin’s blog, Anja’s Food for Thought, is a great place to visit. Motivated by a desire to eat more healthily, in 2008 the mother of two made a conscious decision to cut refined sugar and flour out of her diet. She began scouting the internet for nutritious, wholesome recipes and was inspired by the food blogs she discovered. With an increased desire to experiment with natural ingredients, Schwerin started her own “personal food journal and cookbook” and began posting recipes and pictures, often experimenting with vegan, vegetarian, low-sugar or raw food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Her 15 years’ experience as a picture editor are certainly reflected in the quality of her photography; dishes are beautifully presented and many of the photos are striking. She tends to add to the blog two or three recipes a week (estimating that each post takes around two hours, plus cooking time) and says that it is “a hobby that I really love”. The blog has around 10,000 visitors per month, and Schwerin puts its success down to “posting healthy and tasty recipes regularly, together with mouth-watering pictures”. It’s certainly worth browsing through if you want to cook up some restorative, nutritious and unusual fare.</blockquote>

<p>Believe it or not, but I’ve actually never spent a Diwali in India. Until this time, that is.</p>
<p>One side of me sees a massive festive season. Another sees just another excuse for people here to take massive break, relax and NOT work! (Most places have 8–10 days off in a row) That said, the last couple of days (and nights) have been marked by festivities all around, lights everywhere and the loudest firecrackers at night when you try to wind down for the day.</p>
<p>Pictures were sadly taken with a camera phone since I don’t have a proper camera around at the moment.</p>
<p>And for those of you who don’t know what Diwali is, I’ll leave with the (funny) explanation from Season 3 of <em>The Office</em>.</p>

<p>In the heart of Bandra, Mumbai lies the heart of every Indian fast food(chaat) lover- <a href="http://www.elcocateringservices.com/aboutus.html" title="Elco Pani Puri Center" target="_blank">Elco Pani Puri Center</a>. Operating since 1975, this institution has grown from small stalls to a two floor fast food center. And the quality of food has never diminished. Each dish from their ragda pattice to their dosas to the famous Mumbai chaat to their kulfi falooda to their juices, brings forth a tasty, wholesome, full of flavour experience which I have to say is the freshest possible.</p>
<p>This is my must go to place every year when visiting Mumbai. When you are in Mumbai next do go.</p>
<p>Oh, and do NOT miss the paani puri. After all we at Naihar cant do without it!</p>
<p>Pictured above is Dahi Batata Pri, Ragda Pattice, Paani Puri and Watermelon Juice.</p>

        <p>Actually, first of all, I do want to thank you. I mean, waiving my renewal fee and giving me lifetime validity on my phone — pure genius and you guys do maintain the best offers in the market, no doubt about that!</p>
<p>However I have a slight peeve.</p>
<p>You have a ‘more international’ option, wherein I get added credit for a limited time, but only for dialing international numbers. To be clear, I cannot use this credit for a local call.</p>
<p>You have an ‘out of credit’ call option, which allows me to make (only) local calls if I run out of credit on my phone. Super.</p>
<p>On the given day, I had credit in my ‘more international’ plan, but ran out of regular credit.</p>
<p>So when I needed to urgently dial a local number, I got the You do not have enough credit in your regular account to make this call. Fair enough.</p>
<p>I dialed in to the out of credit option, which was kind enough to tell me, You have enough balance on your phone, so you cannot use the out of credit option if you have credit.</p>
<p>So I cannot use my international credit to make a local call, my out of credit option to call local calls says I have balance (in my international credit which I cannot use for the local call I want to make)…so I can’t make the call.</p>
<p>What’s the point?</p>

<p>The festival of Ganesh is marked by specialist sweets — primarily laddoos and modaks. Home-made samples of the latter for this year’s festival can be seen here.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I have the auspicious honor of putting together post number 100.</p>
<p>I can’t give you the cliched it’s been a long journey, because it hasn’t. But it has been a fantastic ride. The naihar food blog started with a <a href="http://posterous.com/site/profile/naihar" target="_blank">simple concept</a> — I wanted to take my family-derived love for food (and the fact that we ran a little catering gig on the side) and share it with the online world. But as is always the case, you want to break the mould.</p>
<p>What <a href="http://www.naihar.com/" target="_blank">naihar</a> has turned into today is a fantastic collaboration of people who <a href="http://www.naihar.com/juicy-juicy-mangoes" target="_blank">love their food</a> — and therefore, people who write <a href="http://www.naihar.com/is-it-a-bird-is-it-a-plane-no-its-an-ice-crea" target="_blank">with a passion</a> — which has brought out a unique blend to this blog.</p>
<p>I can’t seem to put naihar in a category of a <a href="http://www.naihar.com/restaurant-reveiw-on-the-border-tags-mexican-0" target="_blank">review blog</a>, an out-and-out <a href="http://www.naihar.com/chocolate-barfi-kaju-katri-gajar-ka-halwa-pla" target="_blank">food blog</a> or even a <a href="http://www.naihar.com/how-to-cure-a-cheesecake-infatuation" target="_blank">recipe blog</a>. It’s a fun mashup of all three. We’ve covered restaurants in the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/oh-tiramisu" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="http://www.naihar.com/a-thyme-and-place-for-everything" target="_blank">UK</a>, <a href="http://www.naihar.com/wildpeeta" target="_blank">UAE</a> and <a href="http://www.naihar.com/indulging-at-shamiana-taj-lands-end" target="_blank">India</a> thus far. We’ve <a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te" target="_blank">concocted recipes</a> of our own that <a href="http://www.naihar.com/mohanthal" target="_blank">look as amazing as they taste</a>. And we’ve focused on <a href="http://www.naihar.com/tiramisu-58" target="_blank">single food items</a> at times not just <a href="http://www.naihar.com/max-brenner-chocolate-by-the-bald-man" target="_blank">entire menus</a>, so you know where to <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">satisfy</a> <a href="http://www.naihar.com/rocky-road-chocolate-goodness-marshmallows" target="_blank">those</a> <a href="http://www.naihar.com/i-succumbed-to-the-whittard-temptation" target="_blank">cravings</a> (or <a href="http://www.naihar.com/molten-goodness-or-not" target="_blank">where *not* to</a>). Oh, and the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/the-cake-extravaganza" target="_blank">cake extravaganza!</a></p>
<p>What’s up ahead? Well, obviously more coverage of places to eat, things to make and cravings to satisfy. Better pictures. Author profiles. And some interesting changes. We’re working on collaborating with some brilliant foodies out there who could bring an interesting spin to the blog, some food outings and more.</p>
<p>To our followers, we hope you enjoy what we have in store. If you’ve got a moment, do drop us a comment and let us know if there are things you like (and what you don’t really like) and it’ll help our amazing authors cater their posts a little.</p>
<p>Finally, a gracious nod to our unrelenting contributors. I’m committing to the one cliche for the post here: Guys, we could NOT have this without you. Keep the food and, almost as importantly, the pictures coming.</p>
<p>Happy Fooding!</p>

<p>I have now taken my infatuation with the creation of the perfect cheesecake to the next level. Trying to figure out different ways to make the cheesecake set is an interesting if difficult feat. I trawl through cookbooks religiously on a regular basis, for a little light reading of course, as any aspiring cook would do.</p>
<p>Though some would bake the humble cheesecake for the new york style, others put gelatine in to set the cream cheese. I have found the perfect alternative, inspired by the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/bite-sized-demonstration-strawberry-delights" target="_blank">bite sized demonstration</a>, using white chocolate in the cream cheese helps it to set firm. Whats more, it actually tastes of that creamy velvety chocolate and adds a new level of richness to the cheesecake, as opposed to the tasteless nature of gelatine or agar agar.</p>
<p>Whatever the event, try this cheesecake on for size, you will not be disappointed. Different variations of the fruit coulis can be tailored to your own tastes, as per my previous <a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te" target="_blank">mango cheesecake</a>, but remember not to overdo the sugar content. A cheesecake should be sweet and I prefer the coulis a little tart to offset the balance of sweet cream cheese and crunchy nutty biscuits with sharp fresh fruit. Remember folks practice makes perfect, keep experimenting and find the balance that suits you, if mascarpone (which is amazing by the way) is too cheesy for you, stick to Philadelphia. If you would like a baked cheesecake, experiment with the recipe that uses eggs, but always follow these simple rules.</p>
<p>1. Biscuits: usually a biscuit with a crunch, digestive biscuits, hobnobs, shortbread.</p>
<p>2. Cream Cheese: Philadelphia, mascarpone, cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese is all fine.</p>
<p>3. Toppings: I love berries on cheesecakes, and most recipes point you in this direction, but look at the fruit you have in your fruit bowl, I found a mango and tested out my hypotheses; largely being that cheesecakes are amazing with most fruits, as long as you consider the sharpness and sweetness of each fruit on its own and alter the sugar content of your cheesecake to match. Chocolate is also a great topping. Use your imagination.</p>
<p>4. Have fun. There is no point of being in a kitchen if you are not going to have a little fun, a little drama when the utensils crash and the blenders hum, is what makes the cheesecake or any other dessert turn out beautiful.</p>
<p>With regards to the title ‘How to cure a cheesecake infatutation’: if any of you ever figure this out, please do not contact me. I like to be blissfully unaware of the fat and calorie content of my cheesecakes, for what is a dessert if not a little indulgence every now and then.</p>

<p>I have three words for you. White chocolate clusters. Little bites of heaven. Indulgence at its best. There are no rules, so go crazy. You need good quality White Chocolate, Brazil nuts, (sultanas or raisins if you fancy) and some biscuits. The biscuits need to be crushed, the white chocolate melted, and Brazil nuts chopped. Mix together to form a gooey white chocolaty mess. Spoon into bite-size clusters on baking paper (or as per picture into mini cup cases), leave to cool, and then decorate with milk/dark chocolate.</p>
<p>It’s a winner every time. Its uncomplicated, fun to try with children, and requires very little effort or fuss. So get chocolaty, I promise you these little bites of heaven are as scrumptious as they look.</p>
<p>12 oz white chocolate</p>
<p>10 oz dark/milk chocolate (for decorating)</p>
<p>7 oz Brazil Nuts (chopped)</p>
<p>7 oz Biscuits (crushed up)</p>
<p>note: raisins, sultanas, cereal, sweets, chocolate chips can also be used, be inventive and have fun.</p>

<p>A late night after movie chocolate craving brought me right in front of Starbucks, one of the only cafe’s open at midnight. After going through the selection of desserts, I decided to devour a Molten Chocolate Cake (who can say no?)</p>
<p>Now before you go all how-can-you-commit-a-sin-against-the-holy-grail-of-molten-chocolate-cakes(Chillis to the non enlightened crowd) I merely wanted to try it. Besides, I didnt have much choice a that time of the night. So how was it? Bad.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong here. Molten Chocolate cake in my opinion, has to be made in a particular manner- Rich chocolate cake with a soft, liquid chocolate center. Oh, and served hot.</p>
<p>Naturally when a friendly(sarcastic) waiter asked if I would like my cake heated up, I was taken aback.. But of course it needs to be served hot! Cardinal rule in molten goodness isnt it? So it was popped into a microwave and was merrily swirling around while I made myself comfortable, ready to dive into the warmth of molten chocolate heaven, with rich, moist cake and oozing molten center (yes I was dreaming Chillis here)</p>
<p>What I ended up getting was lukewarm cake — I admit it was rich and moist and not crumbly — with a HARD center. You read that right, it was not a liquid center, rather like having a bar of chocolate stuck into your cake. I finished the cake bit and left the center. Sigh.</p>
<p>Apart from bursting my dream sequence bubble, Im sure I could hear a snigger or two from the Chillis.</p>
<p>Lesson: Never mess with Chillis.</p>
<p>PS: I was so disappointed, I only took one photo.</p>
