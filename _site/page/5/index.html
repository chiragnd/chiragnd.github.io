      <section class="post-body">
        <h4>Indigo owns 40% market share</h4>
<p><span>T</span>he number of passengers carried by domestic airlines in the current calendar year registered a 17.63% growth compared to the same period in 2016¹.</p>
<p>4.66 crore passengers have taken domestic flights this year, compared to 3.96 crore.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Domestic passengers by month</figcaption></figure>
<p>Following a dip between January and February, total domestic passengers consistently grew for the remaining 4 months of the year. May saw a little over 1 crore domestic travelers, the highest this year.</p>
<h4>Airline breakdown</h4>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Airline market share for domestic airlines up to May 2017</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indigo currently holds the largest market share crossing 40% of total passengers up to May, followed by Jet at 17.9% and Air India at 13.3% of total passengers.</p>
<p>Airline traffic saw a similar trend as overall passenger traffic, dipping in February across all airlines before picking up during the remaining months of the year.</p>
<h4>Complaints</h4>
<p>In the current year, 716 complaints have been registered across various airlines. Despite the largest volume share, Indigo has significantly fewer complaints registered (109, at a complaints/10000 ratio of 0.58) compared to Air India (245, 3.95) and the Jet group (231, 2.77).</p>
<p>Indigo also led in terms of on-time performance, with an OTP of 85% of flights at the four major metros (Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai). SpiceJet is a close second at 82.4% while Air India ranks fourth at 77.8%.</p>
<p>A majority of the delays among the four metro cities seem to have occurred at Mumbai Domestic Airport.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/630b2-1h7xrzivqfatzmixvufdjjg.jpeg" /></figure>
<p>In 2016, baggage earned the largest share of complaints (28%) during the same period, Customer Service took this title in 2017 (27.8%). Refunds saw a good reduction in complaints, down to 2.7% of total complaints compared to 6.2% in 2016. Flight problems, baggage and customer service continue to be the top 3 reasons for complaints by quite a margin.</p>
<p>A total of 2,267 passengers have been denied boarding this year, leading to compensations worth ₹1.37cr. 19,175 passengers experienced flight cancellations (₹55 lakhs) while 91,213 suffered delays (₹89 lakhs).</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/06/08/some-comments-on.html">Some comments on Aadhaar or Adhar:</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Some comments on <a href="http://www.vijayvaani.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?aid=4271" target="_blank">Aadhaar or Adhar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Firstly unlike a password, biometric data is not secret and also not in full control of the owner of biometrics. Biometric data today are shared not only with Aadhaar authorities but practically everywhere, including attendance systems and banks. Even on table and doors accessed by that individual.</blockquote>
<p>The same problem (and more) exists with passwords. How do you stop someone from using the same one everywhere (and therefore being hacked somewhere else and then his Govt ID being abused?). From writing it down and sticking it in a drawer or on a computer screen? When it is so easy to reverse engineer, imagine tying critical services to a unique ID with a password? Even companies are moving away from just passwords (or in some cases passwords altogether). So I would argue that a password is not secret at all, and easily transferable and reverse engineered.</p>
<p>So then the question is, is biometrics more reliable and secure? <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/a-few-biometric-concerns-8a1013b36cd7" target="_blank">The answer would seem to be yes</a>.</p>
<p>The video has been taken down so I have no way of verifying it. But considering Google/Apple continue to use fingerprints and every notice so far of copying fingerprint is anecdotal, and that Aadhaar’s CIDR is not using just 3 points of fingerprint matching.</p>
<p><strong>Financial support to non-citizens</strong></p>
<blockquote>Section 9 clarifies that Aadhaar is not the proof of Citizenship or Domicile. This means that benefits accruing out of Aadhaar will be <em>niraadhaar</em> (without basis of Citizenship). It is very strongly recommended that a special mark must be indicative in Aadhaar number itself (like * mark) to show that the person is NOT a citizen of India. The government has passed repeated orders to identify Indian Citizens but there appears to be no progress in this regard. In any case, the requesting entity must know if the person being enquired on is Indian or not.</blockquote>
<p>I think this isn’t the right line of reasoning. Aadhaar isn’t a proof of citizenship (it is a form of identification/authentication), and therefore Aadhaar is not the basis of a subsidy either. Aadhaar is needed to <em>avail</em> the subsidy, not qualify for it.</p>
<p>For example, a certain maximum balances qualifies a JanDhan account, or a certain income level qualifies you for an LPG subsidy. UID then helps ensure that the subsidy is passed on to the qualified person correctly (and alternatively you have the guarantee the bank account was opened in your name correctly). Aadhaar doesn’t help you qualify for EPFO, it ensures you get your EPFO in your bank account, etc.</p>
<p>Point is, the qualification of a subsidy has not changed, and aadhar is not being used as a basis of that determination.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Risk</strong></p>
<blockquote>According to section 11(2), the authority will be a body corporate, which means it will be covered under section 43(A) of the Information Technology Act and rules made thereunder. It also means that the authority will not have protection provided to the government in case of any failure. If for any reasons, any core biometric information is lost, then the authority will be liable for civil liability of unlimited amount. Unlike the other methods of authentication, biometric loss is lifelong loss, hence the liabilities of such loss will be far enhanced. In a case of complete loss, the civil liability may be few lakh crores. Is the authority or the government ready for such loss?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Will the government be morally right to pay for such loss to the citizens of India from the money collected through taxes from citizens of India, for its own incompetence? The Act is silent on this risk assessment.</blockquote>
<p>Fair point. This will also need to be separated against breach (of even rules, not necessarily of data) that may occur within the ecosystem vs by the UIDAI.</p>
<blockquote>Secondly, Biometrics are permanent; unlike a password or a smart card, they cannot be changed. God forbid, if the complete Aadhaar database is compromised (like that of Sony) and which must be expected to be so, the biometrics of all citizens will be compromised. Isn’t it far too big a risk for the government to take? Access to sensitive areas such as defence installations, which use biometrics as access control, will automatically become unusable for life of that senior defence officer. There is no way to correct the situation, unlike password and token.</blockquote>
<p>There are numerous things that need to be done — this is what I stressed on during our Twitter chat — to ensure the system is secure. Everything from encryption methods, process certifications, splitting the DB into pieces so access to a single database does not compromise us in entirely are being done.</p>
<p>Numerous governments collect biometrics from their residents and also their visitors. Do we have any cases of them being leaked and then misused? There is an inherent security by purpose that requires Governments to do everything in their power to ensure the security of this database. Having reviewed within my limited expertise the <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72" target="_blank">access to CIDR bits</a>, i.e., over the API, I am assured that it is not going to be easy to pull data out.</p>
<blockquote>The challenges in this field will increase manifold as financial transactions based on biometrics increase. For example, the government had ordered that App Praman is used for giving life certificate for all pensioners. An individual can create his artificial fingerprint and give to his own family to continue to draw full pension even after his death.</blockquote>
<p>Sure, but once the death is registered and the Aadhaar is then locked, what good is the fake fingerprint? And they wouldn’t be able to register a new person with the fake fingerprint either once the person is logged in. So it becomes a closed door.</p>
<blockquote>Section 14 does not limit the citizenry of chairperson and the members of the authority, hence it is possible to appoint a chairman who is neither Indian nor resident of India. It is, therefore, necessary to make appropriate amendments in section 14 which should state that the chairperson and members should be ‘resident Indian citizens’ only. If we cannot get a reasonably competent person to be chairperson or member of the authority then it is a matter of shame. Additionally, if such persons are foreign nationals then ensuring compliance of Section 16 will be impossible.</blockquote>
<p>Agree, there does not seem to be any limitation of citizenship on the authority, except indirectly and only on certain positions. I agree this should be explicit.</p>
<p>To your other point, you’re right as well, the Act does not quantify what violation of breach of UIDAI members would be (in case of the cool off period for instance). So a) I hope that is correct but b) it must be remembered that the law prohibits a cooling off period, meaning that a Court can then apply a reasonable punishment despite a lack of definition.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship with Software, Hardware and Database Vendors</strong></p>
<blockquote>There has been repeated questioning of the UPA government in respect of the contract it has signed with various software and hardware providers and database maintainers, especially the contractual agreement between the Authority and MongoDB. Neither the UPA government nor the NDA government issued any clarification in this regard.</blockquote>
<p>The issue I have the constant mention of MongoDB is that there is no mention of this anywhere. To some extent, the level of agreement and other specific details of the infrastructure should be limited (and clearly is). What has been made clear is that multiple technologies are in use (for example 3 open source softwares are in use for deduplication) with a focus on open source to eliminate proprietary restrictions or lack of support.</p>
<blockquote>If the silence is considered as acceptance of this contractual flaw, then section 22B has extended this contractual liability forever and shared the private sensitive data of Indian citizens and residents with the US government. The charges are serious and silence is not an answer.</blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe silence makes something accepted or contractual. Do we have a right to know — thereby giving someone with malintentions the right to know — this we can debate. While I have heard the MongoDB arguments multiple times, I’m yet to see anything verified that use of MongoDB automatically hands anything to the US Government, but the problem with something ambigious is both sides can keep fighting without something verifiable. That said, if Aadhaar is disconnected from the open world (as it is listed to be), connectible only via verified vendors and through specified APIs, this would still severely limit any one’s access to data.</p>
<p>But the point you make here starts with an assumption, and if that assumption is wrong, then the rest does not flow. There has been no indication that technical safeguards are not in place — things like separating storage of different pieces of data across independent DBs, encryption models — which are in fact in place.</p>
<blockquote>Section 23(2)(c)empowers the Authority to appoint an entity for operation of Central Identity Database Repository (CIDR). However, no limitation has been put in this regard that Indians’ core sensitive data will not be handed over to a foreign entity. There is a precedence of such misuse, which has serious national security impact.</blockquote>
<p>Actually the law is quite clear re: core sensitive data, coming from Section 29 (1)(a), that it cannot be shared ‘with anyone for any reason whatsoever,’ other than for ‘national security’, which in turn, has to be verified by an Oversight Committee, followed by a Court order.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt to Risk Transfer</strong></p>
<blockquote>The risk in case of leakage of personal sensitive data of ALL Indian citizens is enormously high and irreparable. Once biometrics are lost they are lost forever, no change is possible. Through Section 28 (4)(c ), the Act has made a weak attempt to transfer such risks to the consultants and advisers which is neither practical nor possible to meet the civil liabilities in case of loss of any core biometric information. In case the decision to implement any advice is that of the Authority then the liability also must rest with the Authority. Only limited liability up to the fee so paid can be charged from Advisers and consultants. No court will support such open-ended provision.</blockquote>
<p>With over 400 crore auth transactions and no clear stealing of data having been done, this is an assumption. Yes the risk is high and hence the safeguards are also high.</p>
<p>Where does the Act limit liability of violation? In fact, due to Section 29 (1), sharing core biometric data is a serious violation of law, even if punishment has not been specified.</p>
<p>Second, Section 28(4)(c ) actually imposes requirement on the UIDAI to ensure that agreements are entered into are correct and compliant with the Act. The Act says that core biometric data cannot be shared with anyone. Therefore any agreement that allows this sharing is a continued violation of this law, as well as any provisions under IPC/IT Act. See the immediate next Section 28(5) that no one in the Authority can reveal information inside the CIDR to “anyone”.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence Gathering</strong></p>
<blockquote>The Bill at Section 13(3) allows the intelligence agencies to dip into the core biometric information and even extract it for an individual or group</blockquote>
<p>No idea what this is. There is no section 13(3) and no, no intelligence agency has any provision within the Act to “dip into the core biometric information”.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2014, the CBI wanted Aadhaar biometric details of an individual, which the High Court ordered. The UIDAI filed a response in the Supreme Court, to which the <a href="http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/2524201422432014p.txt" target="_blank">Supreme Court ordered</a>, and I quote:</p>
<blockquote>“In the meanwhile, the present petitioner is restrained from transferring any biometric information of any person who has been allotted the Aadhaar number to any other agency without his consent in writing.”</blockquote>
<p>The UIDAI’s request was upheld and the Court ruled that even transfer of information to investigative agencies had to be done with ‘consent’ of the holder.</p>
<blockquote>Additionally, the Act is silent on security and privacy of the databases collected by Intelligence Agencies over a period of time, interacting with CIDR. And with this single mechanism, Gestapo or Nazi type operations can be easily launched. Unlike many advanced countries, India does not have an Intelligence Services Act to fix accountability. Hence this can lead to serious breach to freedom of citizens. (I have personally suffered such abuse by Intelligence Agencies).</blockquote>
<p>I feel you are referencing the Bill 2010 perhaps. The 2016 Act is *not* silent on security or privacy of interacting with the CIDR, and the Regulations further define this. While i’m sorry you have sufferenced abuse by Intelligence Agencies, this does not flow from the law.</p>
<p>To clarify, I understand you’re targeting the implications of breach. But the question is always in the process — is the law solid, and then if so, is it being implimented/adjudicated correctly. So my argument is that the law actually entails enough provisions to help protect everywhere and illegitimize items like you mention in terms of interacting with CIDR.</p>
<p><strong>Target of Cyber warfare</strong></p>
<blockquote>Central Identity Data Repository (CIDR) will be a valid and lucrative target for cyber war. Operation PRISM, Vault 7 and many other leakages of information of NSA (USA) have clearly established that the agenda of United States is to have cyber supremacy over the world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[…] It may be noted that the RSA designed algorithm has inbuilt security loophole for the US Government to hack into any system / individual using it. Therefore unless such algorithm, including its random seed generator are written, vetted and certified in India, it will be serious cyber war-related security threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>India has the capacity to write such codes and vet + Certify them, but it is not clear if the source code of these algorithms have been written in India and vetted by a different Indian authority or not. In case these are provisioned directly from where the software and database have been procured, then it must be assumed that CIDR stands already compromised, and US government already has Aadhaar CIDR data.</blockquote>
<p>Again we’re starting with an assumption, which if incorrect crumbles the entire argument. What is however clear from various technical documents published by the UIDAI, the CIDR does not run on a single piece of software and therefore even if we were to concede that a piece of software came direct and the US government has some way to break that (remember that just hackable software isn’t enough, you need to be able to reach the servers running *that* piece of software to do something with it, but fine), even then it does not automatically flow that the US Government has Aadhaar data.</p>
<p>RSA is not the *only* encryption algorithm in play. In the layer where it is involved, it is combined with ECB. The other encryption layer uses AES/SHA-256. <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72" target="_blank">I have already highlighted</a> how well each of these algorithms are rated, and cite a report by the European Network of Excellent in Cryptology. I will make the assumption here that they would not be going around recommending encryption that is loopholed by the US Govt.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Punishment with Complex Procedures</strong></p>
<blockquote>Chapter VII of the Act shows that the Government is NOT serious to punish anyone in case of any breach. On one hand, the Act agrees that it is collecting personal sensitive data of all residents of India, but on the other hand, there is no offence mentioned which has punishment more than three years of imprisonment.</blockquote>
<p>The argument is subjective, but as we debated on Twitter, offences can be compounded with IPC or the IT Act, which carry their own terms of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Just logically, the Act has made establishes what is legal. A Court’s interpretation therefore would be that failure to correctly collect data or misuse of data would be, by definition illegal. In the event that the Law does not specify punishment, the Court can fill the gaps. With respect to the offences listed there — such as the case where an agency revealed someone’s Aadhaar number even if inadvertantly — the UIDAI is the fine that has to file the case. The expectation then is that the citizen’s right to grievance redressal (guaranteed under Law as well), will then be furthered by the UIDAI in the event of violation. However, I contend that should the UIDAI fail in guaranteeing the person’s right to grievance redressal, you have a right to ask the Court to intervene, by virtual of it being illegal under the Act itself.</p>
<blockquote>The world is well aware of the case of Edward Snowden stealing this type of information from the National Security Agency of USA. In case of similar act by any employee of the authority, the maximum punishment is just ONE year imprisonment with fine of Rs. 25,000/-.</blockquote>
<p>Edward Snowden stole biometric data? Or confidential documents?</p>
<blockquote>Does the Government intend that if an employee of CIDR who has authorised access takes unauthorised copies from CIDR, he is not a serious offender? On similar lines, if the chairperson and/or members compromise anything related to Aadhaar, no action can be taken against them unless the same authority complaints against itself [refer section 47(1)]. Even Government has no power to make complaint for any such criminal liability.</blockquote>
<p>The law does not guarantee this authorized access, and legally it is clear that it makes him a serious offender, albeit without a specific sentence.</p>
<blockquote>The Government has cut its own hands; it cannot even issue directions related to technical or administrative matters (submitting complaint for an offence is an administrative action and not a policy issue) as the Aadhaar authority becomes ultimate authority in such matters under proviso of Section 50(1).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thus we have a situation where ONLY on the ‘complaint’ of the Aadhaar Authority a criminal proceeding can be initiated; Police investigation is NOT necessary; such offences despite being of low punishment value can be tried ONLY in CMM or Session Court; but no court can give punishment more than three years of imprisonment.</blockquote>
<p>If the Central government would have given itself superceeding powers, wouldn’t the argument have been that ultimately you want an independent entity managing this and not misuse by political pressure? This is the reason for these provisions and in fact, makes sense. But also note Section 50(2): “The decision of the Central Government, whether a question is one of policy or not, shall be final.” We can’t have a discussing about wanting foreign Govts out of the security loopholes that may exist but also want the Central Govt to have powers to use technical shortcomings right? You want the politicos out of the administrative matters — pertaining to maintaining, running operations, etc as well.</p>
<p>The problem again is that of isolation, one rule does not negate the other. Firstly, the police wouldn’t be involved anyway. Second, it must be remembered that everything pertaining to the CIDR and its definition comes from the IT Act (the CIDR is a protected system under Section 70 making it punishable with a 10 year term) and a CII under NCIIPC making even the attempt to break into it an Act of cyber terrorism.</p>
<p>I want to finally comment on this line:</p>
<blockquote>It appears that the present Government has picked up the pathetically drafted Aadhaar Bill prepared by UPA Government, dusted, rehashed it at a few places[…]</blockquote>
<p>How? The sheer number of differences between the two bills is monumental (<a href="http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/aadhaar-bill-2016-niai-bill-2010-text-comparison" target="_blank">see this</a>), not to mention that the Bill did not even have a definition for core biometric data, let alone its protection. This, in and of itself, cannot be considered “rehashed in a few places”, sorry.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue—compounded in India due to our sheer numbers—is how do we ensure service delivery without identification. Aadhaar attempts to solve this bottom line. Without the Act though, Aadhaar was horrendously problematic and I believe the Act takes care of numerous issues that would have severely hindered both adoption and utilization. Unlike other government IDs like a passport, it will be harder to fake—you can still create a fake number for example, but when a services require you to authenticate, each auth will be verified making it that much harder to game the system, which is why I like it better.</p>
<p>Some of the issues you raise such as where things say ‘will be explained by Regulation’ actually are explained in Regulation (there are 5 Regulations simultaneously introduced that specify other elements). My problem arise at assumptions that something is just flawed, or worse, We’d be fools to think there isn’t scope for improvement in the law so I say let’s continue to suggest those.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/05/28/opinion-how-can.html">Opinion: How can we discuss new Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Rules without discussing cruelty…</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Numerous pieces have been surfacing over the last few days discussing the impacts of the Government’s <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/new-rules-under-prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals-act-notified-3980f4802d1?source=linkShare-7570374edbfe-1495963574" target="_blank">new Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Rules</a>, notified on May 23.</p>
<p><a href="https://swarajyamag.com/politics/new-restrictions-on-cattle-sale-will-hurt-farmers-badly" target="_blank">Harish Damodaran, writing for the Indian Express:</a></p>
<blockquote>In short, it restricts the scope of “animal markets” only to trading of cattle “bought for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter”.</blockquote>
<p>I’d rephrase this. The scope of “animal markets” covers trading of all animals, with the restriction that cattle trading within the markets should be for agricultural purposes only.</p>
<blockquote>The underlying objective, it seems, is to segregate milch/agricultural purpose bovines from those intended for slaughter.</blockquote>
<p>I’d argue that the underlying objective is the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Yes, it also does specify that cattle within the animal markets is limited to agricultural purposes only but making the objective of the entire set of rules on one provision paints a lopsided picture.</p>
<p>This piece also glosses over numerous items that are now prohibited in entirety under Section 14, including: hot/cold branding, nose/ear cutting, drenching fluids forcibly or using steroids for purposes other than veterinary treatment, castration, tying nose bags and the like, for <em>all</em> animals. Do these not constitute cruelty to animals?</p>
<p>And even further, we aren’t even discussing <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/meat-eaters-may-speed-worldwide-species-extinction-study-warns" target="_blank">environment impacts of slaughter</a>, and particularly unregulated slaughter houses.</p>
<p>We cannot discuss laws without putting them in the right context, and we cannot rule out the cruelty metted to animals while discussing the Act and its Rules.</p>
<p>Referencing the article above, <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/politics/new-restrictions-on-cattle-sale-will-hurt-farmers-badly" target="_blank">Swarajya Mag adds</a>:</p>
<blockquote>If traceability and hygiene were the drivers of these rules, why have goats been exempted from this; surely those consuming mutton also have the right to get hygienic meat?</blockquote>
<p>The hygiene, storing, moving and other restrictions on ensuring proper treatment to animals in the animal markets apply to <em>all</em> animals. In fact, the only restriction specific to cattle is regarding sale within in the animal market as mentioned above. The rest of the provisions apply to <em>all</em> animals, there’s no ambiguity here. I have no idea where this conclusion came from.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<blockquote>The Modi government has a huge employment crisis staring at it in the face; having a few million more people unemployed is only going to hurt it more.</blockquote>
<p>Sure there will be short term impacts to employment with the new Rules, but should the decision to pass a law focused on <em>preventing cruelty to animals</em> be based on employment? That’s like saying ‘child trafficking shouldn’t be illegal, sure a few children suffer, but think about everyone that’s employed in the child trafficking business’! Is that how these decisions should be discussed, let alone made?</p>
<blockquote>What these new rules are certainly going to do is increase inspector <em>raj</em> and petty corruption, given the enormous paperwork involved. Illegal trade will flourish. And that will only lead to a step up in the activities of cow vigilantes, who will target even legal transactions. The new rules may have noble intentions behind them, but they may end up doing more harm than good.</blockquote>
<p>Since we’re speculating now, here’s my postulation: cow vigilantism will only <em>increase</em> if people willing to take the law into their hands feel that the Government is not doing enough via legislation to safeguard cows and start taking matters into their own hands, no?</p>
<hr />

<p>It would be a grave injustice to discuss the new Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Rules without discussing cruelty to animals. There’s a reason people are going from non-vegetarianism to veganism, even without a direct/religious reason to not eat meat: inhumane treatement of animals in production and slaughter facilities. Veganism has estimatedly grown 3.5x in the UK over the last 10 years. Similar estimates say half of vegetarins in the US are vegan, numbering 16 million.</p>
<p>To only focus on issues with jobs, or new paperwork within the rules and gloss over the prohibition of cruel practices, as well as ensuring decent living and trading conditions within animal markets seems morally wrong to me.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/05/21/evm-challenge-scheduled.html">EVM Challenge scheduled for 3 June</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced an open challenge to political parties to demonstrate if the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can be tampered on 3 June 2017. The challenge is issued to parties who contested in any of the Punjab, Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh elections concluded in March 2017.</p>
<p>More about how EVMs work and the election procedure with respect to EVMs can be found <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/electronic-voting-machines-a-primer-5c5fd03f975c?source=false---------0" target="_blank">in our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>The salient features of the challenge are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EVMs will be treated in the same manner they were in the polls in both voting and post-voting phases</li>
<li>The claimant parties can nominate 3 people to participate in the challenge</li>
<li>The parties can specify 4 EVMs from any of 4 polling stations for the Challenge</li>
<li>The representatives can witness the opening of EVM strong-rooms, inspect the machines seals and accompany the transport of the machines to the ECI</li>
<li>A 4 hour-slot will be allotted to each party where the representatives will have access to the Control Unit, Ballot Unit and VVPAT (if applicable) to prove that the EVM can be tampered during polling</li>
<li>Representatives will allowed to press any sequence of buttons, as well as use any wireless transmitter to prove their case. All actions will be logged by ECI staff, and video will be recorded.</li>
<li>During the second phase of the Challenge (post-poll) wherein representatives can visually inspect the EVM internals</li>
<li>EVMs removal from the sites will not be permitted, and any modification to the device itself would have to be performed within the confines of election procedure</li>
<li>If the EVM become non-functional, or the result is as expected, the challenger will be considered to have failed.</li>
</ul>

<p>All NGOs have been given a final opportunity to file their annual returns within 30 days, ending 14 June 2017. No compounding fee will be imposed within this deadline.</p>
<p>Numerous NGOs are under scrutiny for not filing returns from FY2010–11 to FY2014–15. NGOs that do not file returns will not be granted renewal of registration.</p>

<p>The 2,230 kg South Asia satellite (GSAT-9) was successfully launched using India’s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F09). The launch was accomplished from the Second Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR at Sriharikota.</p>
<p>The GSLV-F09 used 4 liquid propellant strap-on motors, each carrying 42 tons of fuel. The Satellite hit Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) in 17 minutes after liftoff at 16:57 GST. The Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan, Karnataka has assumed control of the Satellite.</p>
<p>The GSAT is currently orbiting the Earth with a perigee (closest point) of 169km and orbital inclination w.r.t the equator of 20.65 degrees. It will be raised to the final circular Geostationary Orbit (GSO) in a few days before being commissioned into service.</p>
<p>The GSAT-9 has 12 Ku band transponders and took three years to fabricate with a total cost of Rs. 230 crore. Its two solar arrays will generate 3.5 kilowatts of power.</p>
<p>It will be used facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, tele-medicine and disaster management support, and is shared by India and 7 South Asian nations.</p>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence awarded to four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case by a Delhi fast-track court in 2013 and subsequently the Delhi High Court in 2014, rejecting the appeal filed by the convicts.</blockquote>
<p>That we have to cheer that at 4 years and 4 months, this was a ‘fast track’ trial resolution is not a great testament of our due process.</p>
<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyoti Singh, the 23-year-old victim, lost her life on 29 Dec 2012 after immense suffering. Nothing can bring that back.</li>
<li>The accused were given the death penalty as far back as September 2013. The High Court (in March 2014) &amp; The Supreme Court rejected the appeals and upheld the death sentences.</li>
<li>The main accused – who inserted a rusted iron rod into the victim, and gutted her intestines – was judged as a juvenile, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nirbhaya-juvenile-to-walk-free-on-Dec-20-Centre-opposes-move/articleshow/50179656.cms" target="_blank">released in December 2015 and given a grant of Rs. 10,000 and a sewing machine</a>. He <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PTI_News/status/860521590806781952" target="_blank">currently lives under an assumed name</a>.</li>
<li>The Juvenile Justice Act has since been amended in 2015 such that the age to try juveniles as adults if they commit heinous crimes was lowered to 16.</li>

<p>This post performs a quick dive into the technology-based and process-based security provisions of Aadhaar data.</p>

<hr />

<h3>
<code>Data </code>Access</h3>
<p>The core Aadhaar infrastructure is called the Central Information Data Repository (CIDR). There are two main purposes for which data is accessed from the CIDR: Authentication &amp; e-KYC.</p>
<p><em>For an explanation on the different entities and their relationships within the Aadhaar ecosystem, please see </em><a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#a8d3" target="_blank"><em>our section on Aadhaar entities</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>A vendor can use Aadhaar authentication to verify you before offering services. This process utilizes your Aadhaar number and either your OTP or biometrics as a second factor to authenticate you. Vendors who use Aadhaar authentication services are authorized by the UIDAI as Authorized User Agencies (AUAs). Each AUA must use an Authorized Service Agency (ASA) — the only entities allowed to connect to the CIDR. The authentication process is explained in more detail <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#4e42" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In response, the CIDR returns a digitally signed ‘Yes/No’ depending on the success of the authentication request.</p>
<h4>Electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC)</h4>
<p>A vendor can use Aadhaar for the purpose of instant electronic KYC. Just like authentication entities, e-KYC entities must be authorized by the UIDAI, and utilize KSAs (ASAs with KYC permissions) — the only entities allowed to use the e-KYC connection endpoints.</p>
<p>In response, the CIDR returns a digitally signed and encrypted demographic record (name, gender, address, etc) and photograph block¹. In January 2018, a ‘limited KYC’ was introduced where only need-based details would be shared with the authorised agencies.</p>
<h4>APIs</h4>
<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the industry-standard method to connect to systems. They allow the issuing entity (in this case, the UIDAI) to maintain control over what information — and in what manner — is shared with the requestor. APIs adds a layer of encapsulation by limiting what is available to the ‘outside’ via targeted requests, thus not requiring any direct access to a data store or database (DB).</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you wish to know how many steps I’ve walked on a day, which I log in a DB. Rather than give you direct access to my DB—which also contains other data which you don’t require, nor do I want to share—I give you an API request endpoint, validated by a key:</p>
<pre>[me.example/getSteps](https://me.example/getSteps?authKey=45aedlfkja359874425)</pre>
<p>which returns:</p>
<pre>{ “steps”: 372 } </pre>
<p>Similarly, the Aadhaar authentication service is done over a URL endpoint²:</p>
<pre>https://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;AUA code&gt;/&lt;uid digit 0&gt;/&lt;uid digit 1&gt;/&lt;ASA license key&gt;</pre>
<p>A separate API is used for eKYC or enrolment. The production server hosts are only shared with the ASAs and are not available online. As such, the API endpoints are not accessible over the internet.</p>
<p>The request format for an authentication request is as follows³:</p>
<pre>&lt;Auth uid=”” rc=”” tid=”” ac=”” sa=”” ver=”” txn=”” lk=””&gt; <br />&lt;Uses pi=”” pa=”” pfa=”” bio=”” bt=”” pin=”” otp=””/&gt; <br />&lt;Meta udc=”” rdsId=”” rdsVer=”” dpId=”” dc=”” mi=”” mc=”” /&gt; <br />&lt;Skey ci=””&gt;encrypted and encoded session key&lt;/Skey&gt; <br />&lt;Hmac&gt;SHA-256 Hash of Pid block, encrypted and then encoded&lt;/Hmac&gt; &lt;Data type=”X|P”&gt;encrypted PID block&lt;/Data&gt; <br />&lt;Signature&gt;Digital signature of AUA&lt;/Signature&gt; &lt;/Auth&gt;</pre>
<p>The request only shares meta-data comprising the device information, AUA signature, etc. and the encrypted PID block. Information such as details of the service being provided, or any details about the holder do not form part of the request. Even if a service provider were to pass such information — and it would be illegal to do so — the only blocks and variables recognized by the CIDR are the ones in the above request.</p>
<h4>PID Block</h4>
<p>When a registered device is called by the application, it captures, processes and encodes the digitally signed biometric record⁴.</p>
<pre>Bh=SHA-256(bio_record) <br />Be=DSA(Bh+timestamp+unique_device_code,device_private_key)</pre>
<p>This is used to finally create the signed &amp; encoded biometric record:</p>
<pre>Bs=base64(Be)</pre>
<p>A Device Info Hash (dih) is also included as part of the PID block:</p>
<pre>dih = SHA-256(device_provider_id+device_service_id+device_version+unique_device_code+model_id+idHash)</pre>
<p>The <code>idHash</code> is an encrypted device ID which must match the hash shared with the CIDR when the device was registered. A separate <code>wadh</code> (wrapper API data hash) is also used for eKYC transactions.</p>
<p>In this way, the PID block is created and encrypted on the registered device itself and the process is independent of the AUA application. The biometric record is encrypted using a 256-bit symmetric encryption session key (AES/GCM/No padding). The one-time use session key is then encrypted asymmetrically (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding) with a 2048-bit UIDAI-issued public key, making the CIDR the sole entity that can decrypt the record.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Once created, the PID block is then signed with the AUAs digital key and passed to the ASA. The ASA then makes the API call, along with its own unique digital identifiers and a success or failure response is returned.</p>
<p>Each device must be registered with the UIDAI along with the device provider’s ID, a unique identifier (serial number), a digitally signed certificate, along with the provider’s key issued by the UIDAI⁵. All of these details are part of the meta-data of the authentication or eKYC request.</p>
<p>Currently, the UIDAI is in process to increase the CIDR’s authentication capacity to 10 crore transactions per day⁶.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>To recap, your fingerprint and/or eye scan data are classified as core biometric information and has a one-way ticket into the CIDR. By law, core biometric information collected shall not be shared “with anyone for any reason whatsoever”⁷.</p>
<p>As highlighted in the <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#8ab4" target="_blank">previous post</a>, the CIDR is classified as a Protected System under the IT Act, 2000, a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) by the NCIIPC and the UIDAI itself is ISO27001:2013 certified.</p>
<p>The following are some of the security enforcements across the Aadhaar ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no connection endpoint that returns a holder’s biometrics, as required by law⁸.</li>
<li>Demographic information and biometric information are partitioned into separate databases secured between firewalls; a single database does not have all the user’s data in one physical location⁹. Raw biometric data is stored in encrypted form within the CIDR.</li>
<li>Connection to the CIDR is only available to ASAs (27 entities at this time) over 1-to-1 leased line or MPLS¹⁰ links, i.e., not over the internet.</li>
<li>Each ASA is allotted a separate DMZ¹¹.</li>
<li>The PID block is encrypted with AES-256 using a one-time session key. The session key is then encrypted with a 2048-bit UIDAI issued key. This makes it extremely expensive to break¹².</li>
<li>The PID block includes a timestamp and a one-time session key to prevent reuse.</li>
<li>The digital keys of the registered device, the AUA and the ASA are logged and validated for every transaction.</li>
<li>The session key used for the PID block must not be stored and should not be reused across transactions¹³.</li>
<li>GCM encryption¹⁴ was added in API v2.0</li>
<li>Network connectivity between the ASA and AUA must be secured via a leased line or at least a VPN/SSL. It is the ASA’s responsibility to ensure this connectivity requirement.</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication (using Aadhaar number + biometrics + OTP) is also available over the API. This is not mandatory as a phone number is not required for Aadhaar enrolment.</li>
<li>In cases where self-service is not possible and operator interference is required to operate a device, the operator must be authenticated and their Aadhaar number logged to perform any functions.</li>
<li>ASA and registered devices do not store PIB blocks beyond a few seconds in cache for buffering. Device applications and ASAs are verified by the UIDAI directly.</li>
<li>Enrolment client software is entirely written, maintained and provided directly by the UIDAI.</li>
<li>All meta-data of a request — timestamp, the entities involved — are made available online for 6 months, and archived for 7 years by law¹⁵.</li>
<li>The CIDR in its entirety is located inside India and all authentication requests route within the Country.</li>
<li>The Aadhaar number itself is random and is not based on any identifying personal factors of the holder¹⁶.</li>
<li>In January 2018, the UIDAI provides the option to generate a further randomized 16-digit Virtual ID for authentication requests so that users do not need to share their Aadhaar ID with providers. There are no limit to generating new Virtual IDs for the same Aadhaar, the old one is automatically discontinued once a new ID is generated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[1] Aadhaar does not independently verify addresses submitted as part of enrollment. However, it should be noted that Aadhaar only accepts otherwise verifiable proof of address (such as a passport, electricity bill, water bill within 3 months old, bank statement, etc).</p>

<p>[12] An RSA study titled <a href="https://japan.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/historical/a-cost-based-security-analysis-key-lengths.htm" target="_blank">A cost-based security analysis of symmetric and asymmetric key lengths</a>, published in 2000, concludes that it would take about 3 million years to break a 1020-bit key with US$10 million being available for hardware. Scaling further, it concludes a 128-bit symmetric key (equivalent to a 1620-bit asymmetric RSA key) — with a budget of $US10 trillion — would require 10¹⁰ years (for context, the age of the universe is estimated to be 1.38•10¹⁰ years).</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/ecrypt2/documents/D.SPA.20.pdf" target="_blank">2011–12 yearly report</a> by the European Network of Excellence in Cryptology II (Encrypt II) rates a 256-bit key as adequate protection for the “foreseeable future”, affording good production even against quantum computers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/algorithms-key-size-and-parameters-report-2014/at_download/fullReport#page27" target="_blank">Algorithms, key size and parameters report – 2014</a> by the European Union Agency for Network &amp; Information Security (ENISA) notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>AES is classified as “the block cipher of choice for future applications”, with a recommended minimum size of 128-bits. An attack on AES-256 is rated as requiring time 2⁹⁹ and data complexity 2⁹⁹, such that related keys are used (and therefore, requiring more time if keys are randomly selected). Breaking AES-256 is expected to require 2²⁵⁴ encryption operations and 2⁸⁰ plaintexts.</li>
<li>SHA-256, used for building the Device Info Hash is classified as “future use” hash function.</li>

        <p>Aadhaar was established as a national Unique Identification number (UID) system. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY), and is audited by the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General (CAG).</p>
<p>This post attempts to review Aadhaar as the verifiable identification and authentication system in India based on a review of relevant provisions within the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and its Regulations.</p>
<p>The next post <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72" target="_blank">covers data security</a>.</p>

<h3>Authentication &amp; Working</h3>
<p>Authentication — the ability to know that you are who you say you are before giving you access to something — is a fundamental tenet in information security. Credibility is infinitely improved when an authorized service provider can genuinely validate you, compared to receiving a photocopy of your passport. In return, you are guaranteed no one else is receiving a service or benefit to which you are entitled.</p>
<p>With this understanding, we explore the Aadhaar concept — a one-way authentication service. A service provider can authenticate you on a) your Aadhaar number and b) either OTP or biometrics, and deliver a service or a subsidy to you. The Aadhaar network does not communicate out of turn with the service provider though, and is not aware of what service was provided to you<a href="#df6d">¹</a>. It only knows which service provider requested your authentication, and logs this for audit purposes.²</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">All Aadhaar authentication is initiated by the user via the relevant agency.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To use a specific example, here’s what a headline like ‘mobile phones will now be linked to Aadhaar’ means: instead of storing photocopies of your driver’s license or passport, the telecom provider (via an authorized service agency, explained below) requests authentication using Aadhaar, and upon receiving a ‘Yes’ issues you a SIM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aadhaar logs when the telecom provider asked for your authentication, that it was successful</li>
<li>The service agency logs the same details but does not save (by law) any other data</li>
<li>The telecom provider logs the request and the result, and services that were delivered. It does not see any other data used for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept is similar to credit card payments, where the service provider requests to charge you via a payment gateway. The gateway collects &amp; transmits your card details to the issuing bank, both of which only aware of the provider and the total charge. The service provider also does not see your credit card number.</p>
<h4>Aadhaar data</h4>
<p>Aadhaar’s core data infrastructure is called The Central Information Data Repository (CIDR). No details regarding its location or type of systems is available.</p>
<p>The CIDR is classified as a Protected System³ under the IT Act, 2000, a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) by the NCIIPC⁴ and the UIDAI itself is ISO27001:2013 certified⁵.</p>
<p>Key facts regarding the data stored within the CIDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name, date of birth, address, gender, and (optional) mobile/email constitute <em>demographic information</em>.</li>
<li>Race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement (benefits/subsidies), income or medical history are excluded by law.⁶</li>
<li>Photograph, fingerprints &amp;/or iris scan constitute <em>biometric information</em>.</li>
<li>Of this, fingerprints &amp; eye scan data are <em>core biometric data</em>, and excluded by law from being shared with “anyone for any reason whatsoever”.⁷ ⁸</li>
<li>Biometric data is also ‘sensitive personal data or information’ status per IT Act, 2000.⁹</li>
<li>Demographic information and biometric information are partitioned into separate databases. A single database does not have all of a holder’s information.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Government to request anyone’s Aadhaar logs within the CIDR, it must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the “interest of national security”</li>
<li>directed by an officer with minimum rank of Joint Secretary</li>
<li>reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of 1 Cabinet Secretary and secretaries of the Department of Legal affairs &amp; the Department of Electronics &amp; Information Technology.¹⁰</li>
<li>pursuant to an order of a court not lower than a District Judge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an order is valid for a period of 3 months, with a possible 3 month extension which must be reviewed by the Oversight Committee.</p>
<h4>De-duplication¹¹</h4>
<p>During enrollment, an applicant’s data is validated against the CIDR to ensure that the holder was not previously issued an Aadhaar number, a process known as de-duplication.</p>
<p>Aadhaar de-duplication is mandated by Regulation and is performed using 3 different biometric algorithm softwares.¹²</p>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>The penalty clauses under the Aadhaar Act provides for¹³:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3-year term and/or a fine of Rs. 10,000 for impersonation, an attempt to impersonate during enrollment or to change identity information</li>
<li>A 3-year term and/or Rs. 10,000 fine for individuals and Rs. 1,00,000 for companies for unauthorized collection of identity information, intentionally disclosing, transmitting, copying of information</li>
<li>A 3-year term and a minimum fine of Rs. 10,00,000 for unauthorized access or attempt to access, download or any play with data within the CIDR</li>
<li>For companies, each person in charge of, or responsible to the company are also considered guilty unless they can prove otherwise.</li>
<li>All penalties apply over and above any other penalties charged (such as under the IT Act, 2000 or the Indian Penal Code)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<h4>Biometric Lock</h4>
<p>An Aadhaar holder can place a permanent lock on biometric data after which it cannot be used for authentication. This lock can be temporarily removed ahead of a legitimate authentication request, and is automatically locked again once the request is completed or after a specific time, whichever is earlier.¹⁴ When locked, an authentication request results in a ‘No’ response.</p>
<h4>Virtual ID</h4>
<p>You can generate a 16-digit randomized Virtual ID to be used for authentication requests instead of your Aadhaar ID. This allows you to mask your original Aadhaar from the provider while still using it for identification. All providers must accept Virtual IDs for services by June 2018.</p>
<h4>Consent</h4>
<p>The Aadhaar Act mandates that consent of the holder must be taken and recorded for enrollment or an authentication request. The holder must be also be informed about the purpose for which authentication is being requested. Failure to do so is a violation of the Act and can be penalized.¹⁵</p>
<hr />

<h3>Entities</h3>
<p>There are three types of entities which share a technology relationship with the CIDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication Service Agency (ASA), 27: Entities with established 1-to-1 secure leased line/MPLS connectivity with the CIDR, regulated directly by the UIDAI to provide authentication services.</li>
<li>Authentication User Agency (AUA), 350: Entities that provide services based on Aadhaar-based authentication performed by a registered ASA¹⁶.</li>
<li>Electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC), 271: Entities that perform KYC using Aadhaar. e-KYC, upon successful authentication, receive a digitally signed response containing encrypted demographic information and photograph for instant, non-repudiable KYC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current live list of Aadhaar entities is <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/list_of_live_asa_aua_ksa_kua.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>, and seems to be updated once a month. Holders are encouraged to ensure they are providing consent to entities on this list alone.</p>
<p>A full breakdown of the ASA-AUA ecosystem, along with the framework to transmit data, is forthcoming.</p>
<h3>Aadhaar Act, 2016</h3>
<p>The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits &amp; Services) Act, 2016 provides legislative backing to Aadhaar as the national unique identification mechanism in the Country¹⁷. The Act superceeds the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/bill_for_national_identification_authority_of_india_13012017.pdf" target="_blank">The Bill for National Identification Authority of India, 2010</a>.</p>
<p>The Aadhaar Act 2016 also provides clear definitions and processes for enrolment, core biometric data specifications, authentication, audits, overall protection of information and the responsibilities of the UIDAI.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this post, Aadhaar cards for non-residents and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) holders is still in the works. No timeframe for this is yet available¹⁸.</p>
<h4>Alternative ID</h4>
<p>A person who does not have an Aadhaar card but is entitled to any benefit paid from the Consolidated Fund of India will not be denied this benefit until his Card is issued, provided an alternative means of identification is made available to the entity in question¹⁹.</p>
<hr />

<p>As of the time of writing this post, 113 crore Aadhaar cards have been issued, and the last five years have witnessed over 400 crore authentication transactions²⁰.</p>
<p>Caution when it pertains to data privacy is both desirable and needed. Aadhaar is an ambitious program that seeks to provide a unified, unique, non-repudiable and verifiable form of identity to millions at a near incomparable scale. The world is taking clear notice of this development. As <a href="https://medium.com/u/d22fa00ce21f" target="_blank">Vivek Wadhwa</a>— distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University — highlights, <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/vivek-wadhwa-america-has-much-to-learn-from-india-aadhaar-a-game-changer-3bda809f00a9?source=---------2" target="_blank">India is pioneering something the West can learn from</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The instant and non-repudiable proof of identity that Aadhaar’s know your customer technology, e-KYC, provides, gives India a big advantage. Most people in the US have drivers licenses and social security numbers. But these are not verifiable with biometrics or mobile numbers, so complex verification technologies need to be built into every financial system. Indian entrepreneurs building applications don’t need to worry about all this.</blockquote>
<p>Beyond entrepreneurs, the fact that schemes or benefits can be rolled out by governments (both Centre and states) without the need to build separate complex infrastructures which then witness on-boarding delays clearly have numerous benefits.</p>
<p>Some of this is already visible, with <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-base-fully-safe-and-secure-says-uidai/story-rMkGys9n1UMnzyKO04BAeM.html" target="_blank">Government estimates of Rs. 50,000 crore leakages being plugged so far</a>. The system has helped root out ‘ghosts’ within the system as well, where <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/87-lakh-mnrega-job-cards-removed-54bad536316d?source=---------0" target="_blank">87 lakh unknown MNREGA job cards were removed</a> or that <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/4-4-lakh-ghost-students-in-jharkhand-manipur-andhra-pradesh-bf50600d3564?source=---------0" target="_blank">4.4 lakh students in just 3 states only existed on paper</a>.</p>
<p>That said, we must look at the law and the implementation ecosystem to determine whether enough has been done to ensure security, and alleviate privacy concerns of the citizens who will need to subscribe to the national ID.</p>
<p>Legally, The Aadhaar Act, 2016 and expansive Regulations for Enrolment, Authentication, Data Security &amp; Sharing of Information, are serious attempts to tighten legislation and processes related to Aadhaar usage. A first-glance comparison indicates that the 2016 Act is a far cry away — particularly in terms of handling of biometric data, and privacy — from the Bill that was tabled in 2010. For example, under the 2010 Bill, sharing biometric data outside the CIDR would have been perfectly legal.</p>
<p>In some (perhaps, many) ways, the attention and eyeballs on Aadhaar is a good thing, where even the smallest flaw would put the credibility of Aadhaar at stake, and should keep the men and women behind Aadhaar on their toes, as they should be.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<ul>
<li>What happens to Aadhaar data upon death? While logs and data itself should be maintained pursuant to legal requirements, a straightforward way to permanently lock (with no option for temporary unlock thereafter) a deceased person’s biometric data should be made available.</li>
<li>There is ample protection under law for violation by any entity — authorized or unauthorized — that performs unauthorized actions within the Aadhaar framework. No statistics around timeframe to resolving grievances is available at the moment. Beyond grievance redressal, should a special Court or Tribunal be instituted specifically for Aadhaar?</li>
<li>It makes logistical sense that that UIDAI has engaged with enrollment agencies to help with Aadhaar dispensation. Now that enrolment has crossed 95%, should the UIDAI consolidate the enrolment ecosystem and annex it within direct control of the UIDAI?</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h4>Grievance Redressal</h4>
<p>As of today, online grievances may be submitted via the <a href="http://pgportal.gov.in/GrievanceNew.aspx" target="_blank">Centralized Public Grievance Redressal System</a>.</p>
