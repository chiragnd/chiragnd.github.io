<p>Saying that we love food and feeding people is probably an understatement.??</p>
<p>Here’s a brunch table we set up when we had family pass by Dubai last year. We love variety, and typically our brunches (this was a milder version) comprise at least 25 different items to sample. And yes, it includes everything from jalebis to fresh fruit to dhokla to bread!</p>

<p><strong>Random things you discover at 1 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The Emirates Driving Institute gets hacked at some point.</p>
<p>They proceed, like anyone would, to remove the hacked statements. But as security fixes go, they do it so efficiently (ie, not like <a href="http://keross.posterous.com/mitigating-web-application-vulnerabilities-0" target="_blank">this</a>) that they leave out the metadata. This is obviously a brilliant move, because you do a little <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_enAE370&amp;q=emirates+driving&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-s1g-sx9&amp;aql=&amp;oq=" target="_blank">google search</a> for them, and voila, Corti is now famous.</p>
<p>Oh, since you’re going to ask, I was on a special assignment from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/samarowais" target="_blank">Samar Owais</a> at 1 a.m. that led to this discovery.</p>

<blockquote>“I’d like nothing more than to apologize in person to everyone we’ve let down, but as you can see, many of our users are rarely home at this hour,” said Google cofounder and president Sergey Brin, pointing to several Google Map street-view shots of empty bedroom and living room windows on a projection screen behind him. “And, if last night’s searches are any indication, Boston’s Robert Hornick is probably out shopping right now for the spaghetti and clam sauce he’ll be cooking tonight.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Either that, or hunting down that blond coworker of his, Samantha, whose Picasa photos he stares at every night,” Brin added.</blockquote>

How many of us are stuck at the point where we started — not been able to imagine what our service would be like if we started today. Our services are vintage the year which they started. Flickr is vintage 2004 when it started. Basecamp is vintage 2004. Delicious is vintage 2005. While they remain great services, there has been no re-imagining of the service so that it fits into the web of 2009–2010.</blockquote>

        <h2><a href="/2010/02/01/the-apple-phenomenon.html">The Apple phenomenon</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Originally posted at the Shufflegazine Blog (no longer exists)</em></p>
<p>Even though this isn’t a psychology blog, it is always interesting to understand how we, as humans, react. And I’m referring particularly to technology. The reason for this train of thought is the hype and the reaction surrounding the release of Apple’s iPad last week.</p>
<p>Quite obviously, it’s hard to be upbeat about the name. I can understand Apple’s thought process — iPod, iPhone, so yeah: iPad. But they do have the iMac, so it isn’t just an i, P nomenclature.</p>
<p>Apple today has a unique fan following created by themselves. A set of classy, elite devices, in their own price and performance range, and a product lock, which tends to put some people off. Yet you find yourself in a publishing house, or even in management offices, and you will see over and over again, how Apple computers have found their way into the elite space. Most people that take the move towards Mac’s never look back. Apple customers may not be as large as the Microsoft customer base but they sure are way more loyal.</p>
<p>So what is it about Apple? Is it the classy, white/black, chic persona they give their devices? Is it the aura that comes with owning a Mac or an iPhone? Is it Steve Jobs? It’s probably a combination of all of these things and a bit more.</p>
<p>Last week’s release of the iPad marks another step in Apple’s revolution. Sure, there are a large number of folks were disappointed or feel that the iPad was all hype and no value. People said the same when the iPhone came out and look at it… today it has even become the choice of phone for the enterprise. Apple brought in the iPad because they felt that there was a gap between the smartphone and the laptop and iPad is a device that does combine features of both.</p>
<p>My points of concern? The camera. I’m really not sure how and why they didn’t put in something that obvious.</p>
<p>Consider, a tablet PC with video conferences, a 10in screen with 3G. It can easily become the portable device for the enterprise as well. The potential is there.</p>
<p>And Apple doesn’t go without putting some strong thought into their creative process. All the iPhone apps will run out of the box with the iPad. I think that was a well-thought out decision. The pricing is definitely a marker as well, considering most people expected a device of this calibre to start at $1,000.</p>
<p>Apple even launched their bookstore to go hand-in-hand with this. If Apple can cover a large range of books in a good range of languages — to the level that the iTunes and App store have reached today — people will adopt the iPad. Even if they’ll never want to call it that.</p>

        <p>The March 18 movement started in honor of blogger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Reza_Mir_Sayafi" target="_blank">Omid Sayafi</a>, who died in Tehran on the same day in 2009. If you’d like to be a part of this movement, I suggest you follow on to this blogpost, giving you details on how to be involved, through videos and a PSA.</p>
<blockquote>Bloggers across the globe are being imprisoned for writing posts that are deemed “blasphemous” or are accused of “spreading false information harmful to the country.” On my sidebar are examples of just two out of the hundreds of bloggers worldwide who are currently serving sentences.

        <p>For people I’m close to, I’ve always tried to do something special on their birthday. Generally, this involves getting them something they’ve expressed desire for in the past. It’s always a pleasure looking at their expression for something I managed to remember :)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sometimes birthdays feel like a grand celebration. Other times, they feel like just another date. The reason for this message is just to say, that no matter what happens in the world, everyone should get at least one wish on their birthday. So here’s a quick shoutout to anyone having a birthday, whether or not it’s a grand celebration, or just a quiet evening. You are worth it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This post, for obvious reasons, is dedicated to L.</p>
