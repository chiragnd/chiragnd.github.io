        <h2><a href="/2012/09/12/goodbye-twimbow.html">Goodbye, @Twimbow</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>On some level, I guess I knew this was just a matter of time. Today <a href="http://www.twimbow.com/" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>, my favorite desktop Twitter client by some distance, <a href="http://blog.twimbow.com/2012/09/12/the-rainbow-vanished/" target="_blank">called it a day</a>.</p>
<p>To give you some context, Twimbow did something pretty unique in organizing your social media experience, primarily over Twitter, by allowing you to color code the people you follow, providing a nice visual experience. Ofcourse it was more than just that, their 3-column approach was way better than the one-column-per-item-style most clients follow and so on. More about this in my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twimbow-a-social-media-client-with-something" target="_blank">blog post from last year</a>.</p>
<p>Just as they were ready to launch version 2.0 however, the glitches began. I had a chance to speak to a couple of their developers, and learnt that the new Twitter API restrictions were at the bottom of it all, and there were in talks to see if this something that could be relaxed. I don’t want to get into it all here, but the tech world is abuzz with Twitter’s recent changes that directly impact their app ecosystem (LinkedIn, for example, had to <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twitter-vs-linkedin" target="_blank">end their Twitter sync option</a>).</p>
<p>It was, therefore, a matter of time before apps that had built their business model and service around Twitter would start to feel it. Based on my understanding, one of the changes is Twitter basing their API-request cap as a multiplier of the app’s current number of users, which is naturally pretty limiting to smaller startups.</p>
<p>This is saddening to see. Twimbow was a brilliant client, to the point where I can’t really stand Twitter’s own Web UI, or most of the other clients out there. Even since Twimbow ran into refresh/API-call limitations, my Twitter activity has dropped drastically since I no longer have Twitter open when I’m at my desk. I still use and enjoy <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a> on the phone, and that’s where most of my tweets come from these days but the future for apps isn’t encouraging.</p>
<p>All said and done, I hope Twitter knows it shouldn’t be killing the ecosystem altogether. Twitter has systematically bought out providers such as TweetDeck to capture a client in each platform/device category, but it <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/29582867630/twitters-api-changes" target="_blank">doesn’t look like they have the skill and/or capacity to maintain them all</a>. With their new restrictions though, apps will continue to die, and while I know that newer Twitter users just use their Web UI which has gotten more feature rich, it still doesn’t have the experience I’m used to or want and at some point, I fear I’ll tire of forcing myself to get on and look at my timeline.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s just me.</p>

<p>Hey, LinkedIn, why would I believe you this time?</p>
<p>I get a new invite every month, then a reminder that it’s the last day…then that I have it for another month. Plus after my experience with them overcharging me (severely) over an ads offer, I’m just not interested at this point.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/08/08/lessons-to-learn.html">Lessons to learn from Mat Honan’s epic hacking</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>If you haven’t read about this hack already, take 20 minutes out of your day and read through the article attached below. While the importance of complex passwords, separating your accounts and more can’t be over-stated, there some simple things you should do right away, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a> in Gmail so that accessing it requires two items — your password and a one-time code — to make it tougher to get in.</li>
<li>Facebook has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&amp;view" target="_blank">few security settings</a> that you should make use of. Spend a few minutes, clear out unknown sessions and devices, and enable notifications when your account is accessed on an unknown computer/device.</li>
<li>Don’t ‘daisy chain’ your critical accounts — ie, prevent making two very active accounts the recovery/backup account for each other.</li>
<li>This one is for everyone that has asked me for this advice over the last 5 years — no, don’t click on a link or open an attachment to something you do not know or understand. If it was really important, the person will find a way to make sure you see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article is a worth read to understand sometimes how simple it is to get access to your life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big advocate of the web in terms of function, use and all that pretty stuff. But everything has its cons so let’s not be careless about it.</p>
<p>To the experts, I say we really need to look at some standardization. The line — <em>‬’[t]he very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification’‪</em> — concerns me deeply.</p>

<blockquote>Meet Mat Honan. He just had his digital life dissolved by hackers. <em>Photo: Ariel Zambelich/Wired. Illustration: Ross Patton/Wired</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…</blockquote>
<blockquote>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information — a partial credit card number — that Apple used to release information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.</blockquote>

        <h2><a href="/2012/08/01/mountain-lion.html">Mountain Lion</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/40dc9-093y8kfjw6kg3wg4l.png" /></figure>
<p>Much like I did with Lion, I picked up the Mountain Lion upgrade to Apple’s OS X the day it was available on the Mac App store. <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/lion-first-impressions#more" target="_blank">I’ve already discussed it before</a>, but this whole download new version of OS while sitting in your room is pretty brilliant. But I’m more amazed when I think of the 3 million downloads at $20. That’s $60 million in sales without a dime in shipping. In 3 days.</p>
<p>In traditional bullet point style, here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>10.8 is a <em>massive</em> performance upgrade. Everything just seems to run faster, and there are huge improvements to memory management (I use <a href="http://www.rockysandstudio.com/apps/freememory" target="_blank">Free memory</a> to keep an eye on available memory). But there’s more. The return from sleep is brilliant — seconds over what was normally a 4–5 minute return. The other improvement I’m seeing is when I connect over to an external monitor — the resolution shift/adjustments take seconds now as well.</li>
<li>I think <a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a> probably kicked themselves in the foot (paw?) at some point by going paid, but regardless, the notification center is a great add-on. More apps will naturally integrate themselves, which will make it better. It’s great though that Chrome is Notification center-ready already. Twitter is so-so; it’s nice to get alerts but annoying that to reply it takes me to Twitter web, which isn’t a good UX. (No, don’t ask what a chirag sexy cake is).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/78c32-0zkqqr4-lqjinbu9v.png" /></figure>
<ul><li>Quirk: Apple has announced that FB integration (at the OS level, and into notification center as well) will come by in the fall. But as I accidentally discovered, the packages are available within Mountain Lion already. Hmm.</li></ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/a63be-0wamfwisgtgzccc6g.png" /></figure>
<ul>
<li>Firing up notification center takes some understanding (a quick google explains it though), but there isn’t a hot key with the magic mouse. I haven’t been bothered by this yet but it would have been nice.</li>
<li>Fonts. I had the same problem with Lion — post the upragde, Chrome’s font rendering went for an absolute toss, and for the font-geek in me, I’m forced to use Safari when I can’t stand it. Let’s hope they fix that quickly.</li>
<li>I like Safari’s zoom-out tab mode. It’s cool. I’m not sure it’s necessarily too useful though — I’ve never thought of it as a problem to navigate tabs, but it is pretty.</li>
<li>Icons seem to have gotten a facelift — well, the Retina Macbook Pro is responsible for that, I’m sure. But it’s nice to see crisper, brighter icons around.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/0ec05-0w1tv8ypfvktu-w9p.png" /></figure>
<ul>
<li>The return of the Save As.. is a welcome one for most people I’m sure.</li>
<li>It would seem that I can no longer view the battery life time remaining on the status bar — requiring a click to be able to see this information.</li>
<li>Freeing up an additional 10GB of space post the upgrade? Sold!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m really happy with this upgrade. The performance improvements alone are solid, and notification center is a good answer to a common problem.</p>
<p>Well there you have it. At least I didn’t do another ‘is Mountain Lion worth $20’ with a cost breakdown post, right?</p>

<p>For me the fun of traveling is getting to sample the local fast food and other cuisines.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with the term chaat is I northern India’s street fast food. Spicy, a mix of cold and hot, sweet and salty, crispy and chewable the famed street food of Delhi is one not to be missed. Popular joints such as Nathu’s, Haldiram’s, Bikanerwala all provide a range of delectable chaat that you can make a full meal out of!</p>
<p>Feast on pani puris, aloo tikki chaat, choley batoore, and so many things that I can’t even possibly mention in this post! Here’s a little sneak peak!</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Note: I was given the Samsung Galaxy Nexus as a review unit.</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/3bedc-0t8enf36i0riujup7.jpg" /></figure>
<p>‘You are so not getting this phone back’.</p>
<p>As far as first impressions go, I doubt it could get much better than that. More so since it comes from someone who doesn’t use a smartphone at all (no, don’t ask). Simply put, the Galaxy Nexus makes for a good looking phone. Like the impression someone at a party in a snazzy black outfit makes, before you speak to him/her, as the case applies. I don’t mean that the phone is bad when you do (or that the person’s a douche, yet), but you can’t know for sure until you have that conversation, can you?</p>
<p>Since the Galaxy Nexus reached me a few days before the acclaimed <a href="http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/" target="_blank">Jelly Bean</a> update, we’ll hold off on the OS discussion until the update is done. At first glance however, the phone looks pretty stable. I’m not a fan of the back though — the approach seems a bit flimsy, and reminded me of those <a href="http://www.meccano.com/models/starter-bulldozer.html/" target="_blank">sets I played with as a kid</a>. Unless that was the idea, in which case they did a great job.</p>
<p>The size of the Galaxy Nexus also takes a bit of getting used to, being larger in comparison to other phones, so this doesn’t seem like a device you can use comfortably with one hand for extended periods of time. But that’s not a real deal-breaker. On the flip side, this display is quite good and the extra screen space makes for better reading.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/70123-0kjxjbfi0dtx0ibtb.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>A nice display and a good churning droid.</em></p>
<p>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to, and so far, typing with one hand requires active use of the auto-suggestions to be quick. The other thing that really got to me though was the position of the sleep and volume buttons that are on the phone’s side (say, in comparison to the top of the iPhone for sleep/wake). This meant I often hit the sleep button accidentally while using the phone, which can take some getting used to. Maybe I’m just holding it wrong.</p>
<p>If, like me, you live your life in Google’s castle from time to time, initial set up is snappy and the single sign-on with your (multiple like most of us…just me, you say? Okay.) Google account is intuitive. Email, contacts, calendar and browser preferences are sync’d without much fuss, the last once you download Chrome on <a href="http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/" target="_blank">Ice Cream Sandwich</a> (I’m unclear of the logic behind Chrome not being default until Jelly Bean, but my theory is <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/google-io-2012" target="_blank">Google just doesn’t think like that</a>).</p>
<p>The Android market — now the <a href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> — is thriving in its own steam, so apps for most needs are easy to find. The experience over the first day has been positive overall, and the phone does justify its generally good feedback.</p>
<p>Stand by, a full review with notes on Jelly Bean will be here soon!</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/07/11/microsoft-and-ballmer.html">Microsoft and Ballmer</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I have my reservations (I believe I tend to be vocal about them) about Microsoft, but there’s no denying that they were revolutionary for the PC industry in terms of reaching it out to the masses.</p>
<p>There’s also no denying that Ballmer just annoys me. I’m not really sure why. Maybe because his portrayal in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0168122%2F&amp;ei=HyL9T_epBMaGswayv-mjBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEyrXWehCYAIYhKg4en4t7dRxj2A" target="_blank">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a> made him sound like an unimaginitive frat boy riding a wave (no offense to frat boys..or waves). I mean…</p>
<blockquote>But we are not going to let any piece of this [go uncontested to Apple],” Ballmer shouted. “Not the consumer cloud. Not hardware software innovation. We are not leaving any of that to Apple by itself. Not going to happen. Not on our watch.</blockquote>
<p>Shouted. Interesting.</p>
<p>I get his point but if they’re going to now drive all their energy towards chasing Apple, they’ll never get there. Apple is known for their secrecy anyway, and they might get lucky but they’ll purely be playing the chasing game.</p>
<p>This is hot on the heels of news that Microsoft is looking at its first loss-quarter since 1986. A <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/26660666648/microsofts-financial-black-hole" target="_blank">holy shit moment</a> indeed.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>A little context. My deciding factor to use <a href="http://www.posterous.com/" target="_blank">Posterous</a> for blogging was actually a video of its founders talking about their drive and process behind putting it together (sorry don’t seem to have a link for it anymore). There are some key feature differentiators why I have continued to use Posterous — and expanded my use to a <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/" target="_blank">food blog</a>, alongwith using it on a <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/" target="_blank">corporate level</a> — but it started with that talk, about their motivation. It seems to factor when I decide on using a product or service, and why I land up sticking with it — understanding its history, the founders and their motivations.</p>
<p>I digress. I came across an interesting post by Posterous’ founder, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/agarwal" target="_blank">Sachin Agarwal</a>, who posted some thoughts about how the ran product management at Posterous, a good read:</p>
<blockquote>I loved the process we had at the end of Posterous’ life. We were working hard, shipping new features weekly, looking at metrics (but not too much!), and we were mobile first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The process also ensured we were working on what we thought was the most high value feature possible, while still dealing with tech debt and bugs. It’s a balance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We had accountability. We knew when we were making mistakes or running late. It made my life a lot easier. It made board meetings easier. I could go on vacation and know the company was powering on without me.</blockquote>
<p>Go on, read the whole post <a href="http://sachin.posterous.com/process" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/30/twitter-vs-linkedin.html">Twitter vs LinkedIn</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>So LinkedIn <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/29/sharing-on-linkedin-twitter/" target="_blank">ends their twitter sync partnership</a>. Or, technically, I suppose Twitter ends their LinkedIn partnership. Either way though, I’m kind of relieved. No, really, logging into LinkedIn to see a clone of my twitter feed was a little annoying, especially since I knew I was losing out on pure Linkedin content.</p>
<p>That said, I’m wondering if this will become a downward slide for Twitter and its content/developer partnerships. Reading <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience" target="_blank">their blogpost</a>, they mention recently enforcing their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms" target="_blank">developer rules</a>, which contains clauses like developers shouldn’t deliver a similar experience to what twitter is already providing. While the intention may be right — it would theoretically push developers to get creative about creating twitter clients — it would also start causing problems for businesses who sole product is a Twitter client which mimics the Twitter experience but does it much better (and typically with much needed features).</p>
<p>One of my favorites — no, wait — my favorite iPhone twitter client is <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a>. It’s a smooth experience, with my <a href="http://eye.chirag.biz/ooh-helvetica-love-my-day-is-complete" target="_blank">favorite font</a> and awesome previews and conversation views available. But based on the rules, Twitter could say they are delivering a similar experience — with a feed for your Twitter activity, despite the fact that Twitter’s own client is a lot worse (being forced to use Twitter’s RT method is not the only problem I have with it).</p>
<p>But I’m digressing. The point is that Twitter — in a fairly decent move on some level to protect their brand and experience — might start alienating developers and other networks if they keep this up. I’m sure LinkedIn was not pleased.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/28/presentations-at-google.html">Presentations at Google I/O 2012</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>There are enough posts this morning doing the rounds about Google’s I/O 2012 keynote that I don’t really need to add to that. But I did want to put some thoughts down on the presentation itself.</p>
<p>Because it bothers me on some level. It bothers me that despite <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/" target="_blank">Chrome OS</a> being out there for a while (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chrome_OS_21.0.1172_Aura_Dev.png" target="_blank">looks decent too</a>), and official Chromebooks shipping for over a year, Google couldn’t use one to do the presentation. (They instead used a Macbook whenever they needed a browser, in case you were wondering). Subconsciously, and maybe this isn’t true for everyone, but the only thing it tells me is that they couldn’t pull of or be happy with doing the presentation on Chrome OS. ‘Oh we love Chrome OS, but for serious presentations, we just use, you know, Apple.’</p>
<p>Take example 2. When talking about <a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts" target="_blank">Project Glass</a> — kudos to Google on what everyone agrees was one of the best tech product launches, ever — the presenter mentioned how it was the future. And how, today, when people want to search, they just pull out their phones. Cue a high res picture of someone using an iPhone.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m a Chrome boy. I live out of Gmail. I actually like how G+ is shaping up. But why couldn’t Google display an inherent confidence in their own products to actually *use* them for their own keynote presentations?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/24/i-can-finally.html">I can finally rave about pizza in Dubai again.</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img alt="Dsc02506" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/74de27b5ac.jpg" /></figure>
<p>I’ve continued to stay heartbroken since <a href="https://naihar.com/pizza-pizza-a58e8e51702e#.eb7cevh1t" target="_blank">my favorite pizza place in Dubai</a> shut down almost two years ago, back when my photo skills were absolute bullshevic (thanks, Madagascar 3!). The photos are only marginally better now, granted, but I shudder at <a href="https://naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad-9ce4d2c02c36" target="_blank">those woeful pictures</a>, ew.</p>
<p>As I was about to say, throw me a lightly charred pie from a wood-fired brick oven, that cooks in 3 minutes and I’ll be your fan for life. It’s what defines a real pizza for me. I’ll typically take a look at a picture (or the real thing) and almost instinctively decide whether I’ll like the pizza or not. I had searched frantically for a shot when Jamie’s Italian introduced pizzas at their Dubai outlet a few months ago before I agreed to try them out. Speaking of which, I need to blog about that experience soon eventually.</p>
<p>So it was little surprise that <a href="http://foodiva.net/2012/05/a-slice-of-napoli-pizza-in-dubai/" target="_blank">Foodiva’s post about Rossovivo</a> caught my eye. The review was definitely positive and the pictures got me excited. Could it be, could it? Alas, I had to hold my hopes when the dinner being organized there a few weeks ago was moved after the guest list expanded to a size beyond Rossovivo’s current capacity.</p>
<p>But let it be known that I pestered incessantly waited patiently until another visit was scheduled last weekend. And while I want to let the pictures speak for themselves, we all know that’s not really going to happen.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc02504" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/335bde7ac6.jpg" /></figure>

<p><em>Pic 1</em>: The Bufalina. A thing of beautiy. <em>I wish I’d realized that the menu was not out of the shot enough, but this is where you thank me for revealing 87.5% of the delivery number before the end.<br />Pic 2: </em>The Raffaele. Who knew pistachio on a pizza could work?<br /><em>Pic 3: The Marinara</em></p>
<p>The star of the show — for me, anyway — was the Bufalina: Buffalo cheese, tomato, basil. You could taste the difference in the quality of the cheese instantly and, coupled with the crust, it made for the perfect minimalist pizza I enjoy. I jumped at the tomato and garlic Marinara — my mind forgetting that it also meant there was no cheese on it — but the sauce was the right amount of fresh and tangy that I ate it all up anyway.</p>
<p>The surprise of the show — was the Raffaele: pizza with, wait for it, pistachio! Named after the Chef himself. Frankly I thought it was outright bizarre but I did try a little piece — we all live for bizarre, don’t we? — and I’ll admit the chef gets points for creativity. Pistachio and cheese do seem to go together despite my initial objections, and the women at the table absolutely loved it.</p>

<p>Love the fact that you can watch your pizzas being made at the table.</p>
<p>So finally, a pizza place I can rave about again. It helped that someone used me as a landmark with a taxi-driver to spot the place while I stood outside frantically calling everyone waiting quietly for everyone to arrive; nothing like an ego boost just before you’re treated to amazing buffalo cheese pizza.</p>

        <p>A rather good post by MG with some spot-on points about the Surface. I think it’s a good attempt, but it hinges on a lot of variables, and continues to amuse me that MS is now in the hardware business. Guess who won after all.</p>
<blockquote>On the surface — see what I did there? — the thing seems compelling. It’s a tablet that runs Windows, and Office, and has a keyboard. There’s no denying that the keyboard/cover hybrid is a smart thing to try.<br />Two years ago, I think this thing would have been pretty competitive. Today? Color me very skeptical.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Windows is not free. OEMs will be paying Microsoft to directly compete with — wait for it — Microsoft.<br />Cluster, meet fuck.</blockquote>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/20/review-samsung-slate.html">Review: Samsung Slate PC Series 7</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>My initial thoughts with the </em><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/tablet-pcs/XE700T1A-A01US" target="_blank"><em>Samsung Slate PC Series 7</em></a><em> are available </em><a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>What a difference a couple of weeks can make I suppose. As promised during my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7" target="_blank">initial thoughts</a>, I pushed myself to break routine and use the SlatePC as my primary device over two weeks. Despite the fact that I’m not a traditional Windows fan as such (without getting into it here, the OS just bothers me over time, as any regular Linux or OS X user will tell you), the SlatePC is a good bet, particularly as a work device, with some caveats.</p>
<p>To start with, it’s the software/OS and not really Samsung that’s the issue here, as I’ve already raised. Windows 7 just does not allow you to really enjoy the SlatePC’s potential. With it, I ran the device almost entirely as a desktop computer, plugged into the dock with an external keyboard/mouse. I was unable to really use the touchscreen — either because my fat fingers couldn’t hit the x in one try ever, or because I kept playing whack-a-mole with the on-screen keyboard. The SlatePC though does come with standard specs you see in today’s laptops, so it did function well in this combination.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/49ee8-0epamj4tpoqdm17sg.jpg" /></figure>
<p>But that changed when I moved to Windows 8. For those who are ambitious, Samsung has officially <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/" target="_blank">put up a page dealing with this migration</a> (which I think is smart in and of itself) with drivers for the SlatePC. I did face an issue with the touchscreen not being responsive, but the should-be-patented-process of uninstall driver, resintall driver sorted that out. And the device came alive once the metro layout was in place. Granted, this isn’t a Windows 8 review — which is probably a good idea to put through at some point.</p>
<p>Win8 also made the hardware seem better than Win7 did. For example, battery life jumped for a barebones 2.5 hours to almost 4–5 hours of use under Win8, which made portability that much better. I’m sure Samsung is already looking at putting together some apps to the Windows 8 Store, which might make development easier compared to builing their own custom ‘home screen’ they have on the Slate for Win7.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/92d7f-0clgtsjwrdfi64k-b.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Much better touch experience with Win8.</em></p>
<p>So the net verdict: If you’re a Windows user and need a change or are trying of lunging around a 5-kg laptop around with you, with Win8 you should seriously consider this form factor. I’m sure the release of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/" target="_blank">Surface</a> by Microsoft is going to add to the disruption, but I find it interesting that Samsung has already put together a device in this form factor that is a great fit for organizations, particularly with travelling employees.</p>
<p>I realize I’ve said that (professional/work device) a few times, but that’s because at AED4,500, I feel the price point is a bit steep to become an mass regular Joe device. But this price is actually comparable to current business grade laptops that fall in the same range with the same specs. Let’s not forget how much my shoulder thanked me as I carried just this to and from meetings. (With a shoutout to <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2591582&amp;topic=1693469&amp;ctx=topic" target="_blank">Chrome sync</a> and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> for making my to-and-fro use of two full fledged devices really easy).</p>
<p>In the real world though, my co-workers and customers eyed the device intriguingly. One of my customers felt it was a great idea to adopt the SlatePC considering they spend the same on bulkier 14" laptops that every travelling user they have complains about. And I’ll concede that note taking directly to soft copy made me immensely happy. As did interviewing and marking off CVs directly on screen. No, no screenshots of that are available, sorry.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/10028-0lgomjersgg7iazof.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>So I’m geeky. Like you didn’t know.</em></p>
<p>There you have it. A good piece of hardware, a pretty looking device too and a tricky OS. Win7 might not let you get everything out of the device, but with Win8, there is tremendous potential. I don’t think Samsung really intends this to be a professional device though (purely based on current marketing and the way it’s listed under ‘Home’ on their site), but I do believe that’s where it holds its true potential.</p>

        <p>I received this email finally on the personal email I rarely give out, after receiving a couple on my more spam-collector email, so someone definitely sold my email address somewhere.</p>
<p>I obviously removed the company’s name..but I mean…what the hey?</p>
<blockquote>We all know the importance of a Will and why we need one. But, sometimes it always seems to get pushed to the back of the queue. There’s always something that appears more important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But there isn’t really. A Will is essential. For everyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Just consider these two points: If you don’t have a Will, you lose control over who will inherit your assets. That is not good. If you don’t have a Will and you are a parent of young children, you will lose control over who looks after them after you’ve gone. That is even worse…</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here at [XYZ], we provide an individual and highly personal service in the area of Will writing. Your Will would be drawn up by an experienced UK family solicitor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Everything is tailored to your individual and specific requirements. We will help you create a Will to suit you and your family. We do not produce a computer template Will, with just the name changed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We also provide a whole range of additional related benefits too. For example, we have vast experience in estate planning, financial protection and investments — and these could be discussed at the same time, if you wish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another advantage to you, are our highly competitive costs. For the production of a bespoke Will (written by human hand), our charges are significantly lower than all of our competitors in the market.</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, if you don’t have a will, why not do something about it TODAY? It could be the most important decision you ever make. We can offer you an unrivalled range of attractive benefits, including:</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A friendly, personal and individual Will writing service</li>
<li>Your Will drawn up by an experienced UK Solicitor</li>
<li>Additional services can include estate planning, financial protection and investments</li>
<li>Comprehensive knowledge of Local UAE Law</li>
<li>Extremely competitive fees</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>To take the first step is simple. Just email us at [XYZ].</blockquote>
<blockquote>We look forward to hearing from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>With warm regards<br /><br />Linda</blockquote>
<p>Yeah…no.</p>
