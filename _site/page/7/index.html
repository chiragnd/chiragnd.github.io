        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/arvindvirmani2/posts/736804226486834" target="_blank">Arvind Virmani, former CEA (2007–09) writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>(1) Sales which had happened during April-October but had not been declared, brought on the books.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(2) Artificial Sales receipts created to show accumulated cash as earned income to be able to safely deposit in bank.</blockquote>
<p>Evidence of (2) in entirely anecdotal at this point, so there is little to estimate really what/how much of this contributes to the growth bump. However, whether successful or not in ‘bypassing’ an Income Tax notice, the revenue is on the books and part of the formal economy now.</p>
<blockquote>(3) Temporary shift of consumer demand from unorganized to organized (taxed) sector so as to able to use cheque she or digital payments based on bank saving , as unavailable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(4) Temporary shift in production from cash strapped unorganized sector to organized/tax paying sector operating on cheque &amp; formal credit</blockquote>
<p>As Virmani himself mentions, both these factors repeating themselves will depend on how much of this shifts back to the ‘unorganized’ sector again as cash returns to the economy. While examples of this is still anecdotal as well, I expect a large number within the unorganized sector will choose to move into the organized framework, so the overall trend line will stay steady.</p>
<p>Additionally, the gains of demonetization starting to prop up growth via expanding the formal accounted economy is starting to show its weight in numbers.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-gdp-idINKBN16836O" target="_blank">Rajesh Kumar Singh, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the October-December period came in at 7.0 percent, a tad slower than 7.4 percent in the previous quarter but much faster than the 6.4 percent expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.</blockquote>
<p>Yet another ‘economist-puzzling’ number as the Reuters’ headline reads. However, economists should notice that this is in-line with others such as <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/nielsen-survey-consumer-confidence-hits-10-year-high-c539d1b03063?source=---------1" target="_blank">consumer confidence at a 10-year high</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/retail-inflation-lowest-in-5-years-ac3969b0178a?source=---------4" target="_blank">retail inflation hitting 5-year lows</a>. For context, this is the first GDP number available since demonetization, and also covers the core ‘trouble’ November-December phase.</p>
<p>It’s obviously normal to find economists of both sides of any argument, so there is little doubt that predictions range sizably in a situation where an economic exercise of these proportions has never been carried out before (anywhere). That numerous economists don’t seem to want to acknowledge the actual numbers, or analyze the undercurrent that is behind these numbers, is on them.</p>

<p>Another good element is the launch of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT-In) in the States, rather than just at the Centre.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/02/19/while-digitalisation-has.html">While digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/india-digital-payments-cash-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">Rupa Subramanya, writing for the Observer Research Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Using data on the value of Point of Sale, Debit and Credit Card (PoS) transactions going back to April 2011, the earliest for which data is readily available, and the value of Immediate Payment Systems (IMPS) from September 2012, again the earliest for which data is available, I trace the dynamics of these two important components of digital payments.</blockquote>
<p>As always, Rupa brings in elaborate research and looks at longer-term trends.</p>
<p>On digitalization of the economy:</p>
<blockquote>It’s a no brainer that digitalisation of the economy has been underway well before demonetisation and is sure to continue post-demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/retail-inflation-lowest-in-5-years-ac3969b0178a#.4lb1u9dek" target="_blank">I raised a similar point about the drop in inflation</a>. Analyses that only look at trends post-demonetization fail in many ways, particularly in understanding how demonetization was an impetus, not a sudden strategic change in the larger picture. To this point:</p>
<blockquote>The crux is that those who claim that digitalisation fell in January by looking at only two or three data points completely miss the fact that this is still more than we would have had if demonetisation hadn’t occurred! The narrative of a sharp rise and then drop in digitalisation is simply misleading and based on poor data analysis. Even a cursory analysis of long term trends shows we’re still above trend, due to demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p>On cash in the economy:</p>
<blockquote>…while digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant. It’s necessary to stress that this trend for cash incorporates a couple of months of data following demonetisation. If demonetisation indeed leads to less cash in the economy, we should see this elasticity fall over time.</blockquote>
<p>India has been a predominantly cash economy, and that’s not just a colloquial statement. After all, 1000 and 500 Rupee notes comprised 86% of the denomination in circulation. Even the Government has been focused on the narrative of a ‘less-cash’ economy. While numbers haven’t been revealed yet by the RBI, it does seem that the final cash in circulation number will be far short of the Rs. 15.44 lakh crore that was in circulation on Nov 8.</p>
<p>Rupa also correctly concludes that the foot cannot be lifted off the peddle now, not for quite a while. Read on for a detailed analysis, salivating stuff for the data nerds out there.</p>

        <p><a href="http://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/idINKBN15S1BB" target="_blank">Shailesh Andrade, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Consumer prices rose by an annual 3.17 percent last month — their slowest pace since January 2012, when the government launched the current index series.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 3.22 percent from a year earlier, compared with December’s 3.41 percent increase.</blockquote>
<p>The article attributes the higher than expected drop to demonetization. The data, though, seems to indicate that while demonetization may have supplemented the decline, it is not the root cause — there has been a near consistent decrease in inflation since 2014, and would imply other economic and governance reasons are also playing a part. The trendline therefore makes for positive reading.</p>
<p>Since July 2016, which is the peak 6% seen last calendar year and 3 months pre-demonetization, it has dropped consistently month-to-month to end at 3.17% in January.</p>

<p>Those are good numbers that will boost India’s now active ‘Act East’ mantra. That said, shouldn’t we be trying to at least go 3G with new lines? Considering the target completion date, North East citizens will <em>finally</em> get just 2G connectivity in 2019?</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2017-18/bs/bs.docx" target="_blank">From Arun Jaitley’s budget speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote>142. During the period 8 November to 30 December 2016, deposits between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh.</blockquote>
<p>This amounts to INR5.48 lakh crores. On average though, what percentage of people who have INR 5 lakhs+ in cash have it for say a wedding or house purchase due to the requirement of cash/black money? Also, this is based on deposits made, so perhaps more than one deposit could have been made by the same person in different accounts, which will be tallied down the road.</p>
<p>This would imply that a decent volume of this cash could be both probed, and result in further tax collections.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<blockquote>Deposits of more than Rs 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs 3.31 crores.</blockquote>
<p>That’s another INR 4.89 lakh crore, and again, questions would be raised about availability of cash per person in excess of 3 crores.</p>
<p>This would imply that a good percentage of about INR 10 lakh crores of deposits (out of a total INR 15.44 lakh crores estimated to be in circulation) will result in tax collections.</p>
<p>So far, about <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/18-lakh-taxpayers-to-get-it-notices-to-explain-large-deposits-4500918/" target="_blank">18 lakh notices have already been sent out</a> in cases where deposits do not seem to be inline with income tax returns.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has shut down 12 websites and 12 mobile applications, while directing closure of 26 additional websites and applications for unauthorized Aadhar-related services including downloading Aadhar card to residents, while illegally collecting Aadhaar number from residents.</p>
<p>The closure is allowed under Section 38, Chapter VII of the Aadhaar Act, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>“punishment … for Whoever, not being authorized by the Authority, intentinoally accesses or secures, downloads, copies or extracts any data from the Central Identities Data Repository, or stored in any removable storage medium…”</blockquote>
<p>The names of the sites have not been disclosed thus far.</p>
<p>The UIDAI also suggests that any person losing his Aadhaar card should download an e-card from UIDAI’s official website, or visit authorized Common Service Centres or Aadhaar’s Permanent Enrollment Centers.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://medium.com/u/5c6977d2a94f" target="_blank">M.G. Siegler</a>’s yearly ritual, here’s my home screen as of the first day of 2017. Most of these are fairly obvious, but I’ll add some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>WhatsApp/Social apps + photos + google maps are pretty much no brainers.</li>
<li>I don’t why Apple News is still here, I never open it.</li>
<li>At some point, I’ll dissolve Reminders and stick with just the one to-do app (2Do).</li>
<li>Yes, Outlook is current email client of choice on iOS.</li>
<li>Messages is blowing up thanks to all the places who have my mobile number and insisted on wishing me a Happy 2017 #iFeelSoPopular</li>
<li>MyFitnessPal is pretty much on its way out since the arrival of the Apple Watch. Granted, its purpose was altogether different, but my zeal to track everything I eat died about 45 days after I started.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you in 2018.</p>

<p>I use headphones a lot. All my calls are done with headphones, unless I blunderously forget them at home in the morning. I also seem to have lost my tolerance to hold up a phone to my face for more than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I know Bluetooth headphones have tons of potential; I really enjoyed using the Parrok Zik phones with gesture support during my review a while ago, although I’m more an in-ear guy. But Bluetooth isn’t the easiest to use, pairing with multiple devices has been a pain, and there’s the lag problem. I can’t watch videos over my speaker bar using Bluetooth (I’ve noticed this with my car Bluetooth as well, but one doesn’t watch videos in the car to care enough really).</p>
<p>I’ve used the standard Apple headphones — I mean they do as advertised. I’m no audiophile so I can live without bass in general. It’s just, I have to untangle them multiple times a day. I usually shove my headphones into a pocket or a bag so it’s an ongoing battle.</p>
<p>What I’m rather obviously leading to is that the AirPods were an interesting announcement to me. There’s the obvious advantages: the W1 chip promises better connectivity &amp; pairing, true wireless — each ‘pod’ collects and plays sound independently while in sync with the other. I’m also mainly on Apple devices so pair once, use on all your iCloud devices definitely caught my eye. I don’t own an iPhone 7 mind you — I’ve made it through the I-want-to-upgrade-but-my-phone-works-just-fine phase successfully with some difficulty, but I think I can wait until the 7S comes out next year. #firstWorldProblems</p>

<p>Back to the review. I’ve had the AirPods for over a week now and they’re a delight to use. Well they’d better be considering the price tag. After some serious underpromising — 3 weeks expected shipping, followed by a Jan 3 delivery date, revised to Dec 20 — the AirPods arrived 8 a.m. Dec 19. Took all of 10 seconds to pair the iPhone and iPad. My MacBook (is old, and doesn’t support Bluetooth 4) didn’t pick it up, but a quick regular Bluetooth pairing process later, we were good to go. I also attempted to pair the AirPods with a Windows 7 PC — they did pair but Windows couldn’t find a driver for them, so I haven’t been able to use them as of the time of writing this review. I also have no idea if the behavior is different on Windows 10.</p>
<p>They do take a bit of getting used to, and I’m still getting the odd stare when I walk with them on (which is nearly all the time). They are incredibly light and you don’t realize how much having a wire tugging at earpieces adds weight to your ears … I have yet to drop them or send my phone catapulting to the floor because the wire got caught in something.</p>
<p>You suddenly don’t feel bound to your phone and it’s <em>very </em>easy to forget inside your ears if there’s no music playing.</p>
<h4>Battery</h4>
<p>Battery life has been very comfortable.</p>
<p>As a full test, I charged the pods + case on a Tuesday evening around 9 p.m. I forced myself to use the AirPods all day Wednesday between music and calls upto about 6 p.m., stopping just to charge the pods in the case when they ran out. If I wasn’t on calls, the pods ran for 5+ hours. At home, I watched about an hour of Netflix on the iPad with the pods and took another call.</p>
<p>On Thursday I didn’t force their use and listened to music as I would normally, with more interruptions compared to Wednesday. I returned the pods to their case when I wasn’t using them.</p>
<p>I took a conference call around 3 p.m. on Thursday with the pods themselves already at about 12%. When they touched 10% (a little beep sounds to inform you of this), I placed one pod back in the case to charge while using pod 1. In about 5 minutes, pod 2 had reached about 32%, so I swapped pods, continuing the call on pod 2 alone. Since I could go longer, I waited about 15 minutes before I swapped again, this time pod 1 was at a healthy 70-something. Once pod 2 touched 50%, I used both pods until the call was over. (I did have a lightening port available to me, but I didn’t want to re-charge it until absolutely necessary). So basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pods naturally lose battery faster when you’re on a call than just listening since the mic/noise cancellation are at play.</li>
<li>The pods charge much faster than they discharge (and this was while I was on a call). This allowed me to charge one when I was low on battery enough to swap this couple times and have 50%+ charged AirPods available to me without interrupting my call.</li>
<li>Even if you have about 5 hours per pod, if you’re short on case charge, you could technically get about ~10 hours with using just one at a time before anything needs to be charged. Since the case charges with the same lightening port though, I haven’t yet been in this situation yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recharged the case late Thursday evening. My overall experience is that the only difference in usage of the wired vs wireless is that the wireless ones are charging in their case when I’m not using them while the wired ones are shoved in a bag or across my nightstand.</p>
<h4>Video</h4>
<p>There also hasn’t been any lag at all. I’ve watched a decent share of netflix and YouTube since getting the AirPods. I’ve watched a video on my iPhone, then switched to the iPad and watched an episode and the only stop is changing the output on the iPad to pick up the pods. It is as seamless as advertised.</p>
<h4>Range</h4>
<p>Reports say you can go as far as 150m away from your phone. I haven’t measured this, but I can happily walk all over my room without losing connectivity, and I’ve walked around the office around corners and it takes a while to lose connectivity. It also picks up as soon as I’m back in range and keeps playing. Yes, removing a single pod instantly stops music or video; returning the pod resumes music but doesn’t do the same with say a Netflix video. I did this with my wired ones all the time to have a quick talk or to place an order and not having the music continuing in your other ear without having to fidget with the phone is nice.</p>
<h4>Problems?</h4>
<p>Apple is allowing you to buy pods individually it seems, but that doesn’t make me feel any better about my fear of losing one. With some conditioning, I generally return them to their case when not in use. I’m also hoping battery life won’t drop too drastically over time. But I’ve enjoyed a feeling of not being bound to my phone — both literally and figuratively. I can actually leave my iPhone behind and take my weekly stroll for example.</p>
<p>What do I miss? Easily skipping tracks. I’m not much of a Siri user, and using Siri to change tracks is far too slow. Siri’s voice capture has either improved over time, or is just better with the AirPods mic though. The AirPods obviously have a restrained surface area to support gestures, but I wouldn’t have minded a slide to skip or such. As opposed to just a tap to receive calls aka Bluetooth dongles of er, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/07/30/review_apple_iphone_bluetooth_headset" target="_blank">2007</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of wires and how light the AirPods are almost feels like music is playing in your head. It’s oddly liberating. I’ve also dropped my phone less when the wire would get caught in something; or get yanked out of my ear. In fact, the AirPods did not drop out of my ears once, doing anything one would normally expect to do: sit, stand, get under the table to sort out wires, walks, light jogs, sideways tilts. As I mentioned, I almost forget they’re there if music is not playing. I suppose it feels more odd to the person you’re talking to; I’m not being rude, I have genuinely forgotten I’m still wearing them.</p>
