      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Saw an <a href="http://twitter.com/AtulChitnis/status/75773775345496064" target="_blank">interesting tweet</a> on my timeline this morning relating to first day at a first job and advice surrounding it. This became a great list of 20 tips (well, 19, since there was no 13th tip) that I think I would recommend anyone read — and in some cases, not just on their first job.</p>
<p>I may not be a veteran, but I can already see how this advice would have been incredibly useful. While I will confess I put a couple of them into practice at my first job, dang I wish someone had told me about the remaining 18. :)</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/05/31/why-twimbow-is.html">Why @twimbow is my favorite twitter client</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>UPDATE, 12 Sep 2012: </em><a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35133587524/goodbye-twimbow" target="_blank"><em>Twimbow is no longer in active development</em></a><em>, and will be shut down once Twitter’s new APIs take over.</em></p>
<p>It started with a tweet.</p>
<p>I’ve been on twitter for some time (two and a half years as I write this) and tried out a few clients pretty early in that span. I rejected the Adobe AIR based apps — I really couldn’t stand the reactivity — and jumped to Seesmic’s Web app the second it was launched. Almost a year ago, I mentioned something about the app when I received a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/filos" target="_blank">@filos</a>, asking if I wanted to try a new app on the block called <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>. Never one to say no to a new piece of tech, I have been an avid <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> user since.</p>
<p>The other day I came across a post titled ’<a href="http://techcocktail.com/twimbow-the-%E2%80%9Capple%E2%80%9D-of-social-media-dashboards-2011-05" target="_blank">Twimbow: the ‘Apple’ of Social Media Dashboards</a>’ and I think I couldn’t have put it better than that. Having watched Twimbow from version 0.1 to the current 1.1, the client has matured and grown through an innovative approach and a smart expansion strategy.</p>
<p>To start off, Twimbow looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fa701-0kyfgaglek6ap2xxl.png" /></figure>
<p>I actually wrote out this post twice. The first time, I attempted to list out every feature in <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> that I use and enjoy. Turns out, I use close to 100% of them and this post was too long to publish. So I’m going with another angle: the top 5 reasons why I use <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> over other clients. So here we go:</p>
<h4>Color</h4>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/f3a71-0cxm7fzep-qlvhkvo.png" /></figure>
<p>Compared to the traditional dark on white, or white on dark client style, <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> takes an interesting spin, allowing you to assign color to users. Similar to Gmail’s labelling, starting with v1.0, you can assign label names. Considering I follow quite a few users, I’ve created a category for food-related things, another for news feeds and the like and so on. The cool bit is I can show and hide any label as required, so I’ve even created a label (in pink) for users I don’t want to see all the time, for example.</p>
<p>As a result, when I get online, I can quickly browse and focus on what I want to see by color, either by filtering out others, or even just skimming my timeline. If I’m in a hurry, I only look for colored users that are interesting, vs if I’m on at a more casual hour, when I browse them all.</p>
<h4>The Solution to the column problem</h4>
<p>Something that is quite annoying — and outright scary to newer twitter users — is the sheer number of columns generated with some of the other clients. There’s one for @, one for DMs and one for every search I have. If I’ve got multi-accounts, then there’s also one for each account and so on and so forth. <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> works in a 3-column environment and that’s it.</p>
<p>This is a perfect time to the mention the awesome and every intuitive Personal Buzz column. Everything related to you as a user — your tweets, @ mentions, DMs to and from, RTs by and of you and Favorites are nicely merged into one column. Mind, it’s color coded, so it’s easy to sort through them (or filter one or more out). I prefer the setting that hides my own tweets, DMs I send and RTs I do, simply because I’ve done them and know what they are already. This makes me happy. And always, if I’ve forgotten what someone replied to me, the conversation view sorts that out instantly.</p>
<p>Gone are the clients that make me feel like I work on Wall Street. Funnily enough, I get really annoyed trying to use them because it just does not feel organized anymore.</p>
<h4>Multi-Account Support</h4>
<p>The biggest change that arrived with 1.0 was <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>’s multi-account support. And boy did they think it through. Each account gets a separate view altogether, meaning you basically switch between your accounts. So far, other clients I have seen merge or have little check boxes to select which accounts to tweet from. Trust me, it’s amazingly easy to make a mistake that way as I’m sure many of you have experienced if you use a corporate and a personal account and such.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>’s way is simple and importantly — visible — so you don’t goof up accounts ever again. Haven’t made a mistake since. Yet.</p>
<h4>The Casual vs Power User</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> is a client that all facets of twitter users can enjoy. This means that the more casual users get to enjoy color coding, inbuilt music player and sharing, and even things like inline image previews (for all major image sharing services) and inline reader (to read links posted) so you don’t have to leave the application. Against this, there is something in for the power user too, easy (okay, very easy) list management, and the awesome monitor at the bottom. If you follow a lot of topics, the monitor allows you to save it like a little searchpad (Think Dashboard on the Mac) that you pull up only when there are updates. The monitor has a little status bar at the bottom that populates if any of your searches get new tweets in them. Handy.</p>
<h4>Responsiveness</h4>
<p>Out of experience, I’ve learnt the the guys behind <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> — should out to @filos and @marchitos — are very communicative. More importantly, they listen to user complaints or feature suggestions constantly. Over the course of the year, most of my suggestions have been taken into account (or was already in the works), and when they set out a private release of 1.0, I can confirm that they solved every issue I posted. To me, this says two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are passionate about what they are doing. I know for a fact that they are disgrunted users of others twitter apps who set out to create an innovative client that is based on what users like to see. So far, they’ve done a terrific job.</li>
<li>They care. They’re listening. A simple search of twimbow will show you how often users communicate with them, and how often they write back.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could, quite honestly, go on about <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>. But the best thing about it is that you can see for yourself. <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> is currently in pre-alpha so it runs by invite only. I’ve got a couple to give out, and you can also visit <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">their website</a>, where they showcase users who have invites available. Ofcourse, you can always tweet to them and they’ll put you on the invite list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> has recently set up an office in San Fran. To me, this is exciting, because they are getting serious about keeping this app running. For now, it just supports twitter, but Facebook etc are already in the works.</p>
<p>Take it for a spin!</p>

<p>I’d heard about the existance of <a href="http://www.chocoa.ae/" target="_blank">Choco’a</a> for some time but it wasn’t until a birthday celebration that I actually went and picked up their signature chocolate cake. If you need a chocolate fix, you really need to look no further. The cake was dripping chocolate from every pore, and was rather fresh. I placed the order a day in advance and as promised I got a fresh cake in the morning.</p>
<p>The only caveat was the writing on the top — the way it was written didn’t exactly match up what I drew up in store the previous day; somehow that didn’t translate to the place where the cake was made and delivered from (the lady told me it wasn’t done at the store in barsha). That said, the birthday girl loved the cake and the golden foil was a very nice touch indeed!</p>
<p>I picked up this cake from the Chocoa just behind Mall of the Emirates.</p>

<p>Well done! Ofcourse if you try to connect with them — as LinkedIn does when you try to connect with someone not within your network — it asks you for their email so you can’t do much. Google pretty much takes the cake each year, but this one is rather cleverly done.</p>

<p>One of the positives to be taken out of being in India for any extended period of time would be the abundance of Lay’s Magic Masala chips. You may feel sick after consuming a packetful or two, but you’d generally consider that finger-licking worth it.</p>

        <p>Consider the premise for a new TV show on one of the many, many channels:</p>
<p>A family has 3 adult sons. The father of the household (traditionally the head of the family) has decided that he wants a specific girl to be his daughter-in-law. So now, he will spend the rest of the TV show’s life (and what’s left of Indian households’ brains) deciding which of his sons she will marry.</p>
<p>Are. You. Kidding.</p>

<p>This was made by dad at home. Whenever I make a mousse cake (last attempt was strawberry mousse cake), it never turns out like this (read: messed up). The one made by dad has the perfect consistency, the taste, even they way it’s cut and presented looks awesome. It was garnished with white chocolate- for some reason (till date) it looks like cheese to me :)</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/01/21/banoffee-pie.html">Banoffee Pie</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img alt="Banoffe_pie" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/6f90d435e6.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Banoffee Pie may sound complicated but it is one of the <em>easiest </em>British desserts to make and also one that got me liking bananas. I don’t quite like that fruit, I’m more of a berries, raisins, cherries, blackberries, strawberries, sultanas, pomegranates person. Did I mention strawberries?</p>
<p>So a banoffee pie is primarily made out of bananas, cream, caramel and to give you a kick- chocolate is used as topping. The only trouble I had was finding a jar of ready made caramel. In Dubai, Nestle does not stock it’s very popular Carnation Caramel and I don’t know how to make it at home so I scoured Dubai for ready made caramel, spoke to friends, colleagues, even asked <a href="http://www.thequestioncompany.com/" target="_blank">The Question Compan</a>y but in vain. Yes, I tried Marks &amp; Spencer as well but nothing! After days of searching and almost giving up, I *finally* located it at Carrefour in Oasis Center Mall. It was hiding among other jams and ready made spreads.</p>
<p>There are some recipes that ask for the baking of the crust of the pie etc etc. I found an alternative to that. Here’s the easy recipe:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>*It really depends how big or small your tart tin is- I used a medium sized one so accordingly, the measurement is as follows:*</p>
<p>- 1 small pack of Digestive cookies<br />- 3/4th cup of solid butter<br />- 2 ripe bananas (throw in an additional one if you are a banana fan)<br />- 1 jar caramel<br />- 2 cups whipping cream (or heavy cream)<br />- Chocolate, for garnishing- I used Flakes (easy way out)</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>- Crush the cookies and mix with the butter. Press them into the base of the tart tin and keep it in the refrigerator for about 20mins or until it is set. It doesn’t take too long.<br /> — Spread spoonfuls of caramel onto the base until it is covered (a thin to medium layer of caramel should do just fine). Place it in the fridge for about 45mins to an hour.<br />- Once the caramel has set, cut the banana and top the slices over the biscuit and caramel base. Spread the whipped cream over the banana slices. <br /> — Top this with chocolate shavings.</p>
<p>And you are done!</p>
<p>P.S. Again- this was the only (blurred) pic I could take before chowing it down</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I was taking a stroll around Festival Marina, Dubai Festival City. There’s a few new restaurants open there but this one place caught my eye: Chocopologie. Needless to say, the name alone was intriguing enough to get me in there within 5 minutes.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/9336b-0euf_ddmnmbiq-pvc.jpg" /></figure>
<p>After being shown around by a friendly waitress, I promised myself I would go there for brunch since they served all-day breakfast! (How exciting is that?! I love breakfast food!)</p>
<p>So within the next few days, I was craving for some french toast. I usually make my own but I do get my extra lazy days when I’d prefer to just sit down at a nice place, order it and have it sitting right in front of me just waiting to be wolfed down. Okay, enough ranting now..</p>
<p>I told my friend Hamna (Twitter Handle: @hamna_), who is a fellow chocolate-eating zombie, about Chocopologie and we decided to have brunch there. We were welcomed and seated by our waiter Ray, who was very helpful and friendly.</p>

<p>Hamna had the omelette stuffed with tomatoes and cheese with a side salad</p>

<p>I had the french toast with maple syrup and a side of strawberry salad.</p>
<p>The verdict: <strong>YUM!</strong> That is all.</p>
<p>Ray was also kind enough to offer us some chocolates to try.</p>

<p>On the left: <strong>Patricia </strong>— dark chocolate on the outside, white chocolate inside with sweet mexican &amp; ancho chilli filling.<br /> Top: <strong>Lauren </strong>— milk chocolate covered in walnuts with a pear ganache filling.<br /> Right: <strong>Kelly </strong>— 64% dark chocolate with a strawberry and lemon tart filling (my personal favorite).<br /> Bottom: <strong>Charlotte </strong>(named after the founder’s sister) — milk chocolate with a basil and apricot filling.</p>

<p>They were divine, to say the least</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, most of the chocolates are named after women. Ray informed us that they were women the founder had met on his travels around the world (<em>ahem</em>) in search for unique ingredients to use to make his chocolates.</p>
<p>The interior of the café has a Victorian theme, not my personal favorite style but quite interesting for a café.</p>

<p>Here’s some more pictures of what they have to offer from chocolates and pastries.</p>

<p>I’ll definitely be visiting them again soon to have a taste of some of their unique pastries. Till then, I’ll settle for drooling over the photos.</p>
