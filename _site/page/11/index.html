      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I still have my very first work ID for when I interned at AstraZeneca in 2004. When my mom first saw that ID (I used to put it up as part of a wall collage of things I had done at my apartment in Philadelphia), her first reaction was ‘You look exactly like Nanaji did when he was in college.’</p>
<figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bc106-099hg4ve4ua79vkgo.jpg" /></figure>
<p>I remember being supremely impressed by Nanaji when I stayed with my grandparents over the summer by myself in the 9th grade. As a routine, every morning at 7 a.m. you would see him fly out the door; he was a man who could not sit still. Laziness was so unknown to him that I am sure my lazy genes have all come from my paternal side. It was clockwork. Out the door at 7, back at 11.45 for lunch at noon sharp. Mind you, he needed his food piping hot, to the point where I had to sit for a bit before I could even consider eating. Back out again in the afternoon, back again for dinner punctually at 7, a habit you did not stop until last week. Nanima may have spoilt me with food and sweets throughout my stay, but Nanaji impressed me with pure action and few words.</p>
<p>Over the last couple years, I was sad every time I visited you, watching you go from being house-ridden to bed-ridden, unable to move around on your own, your eyes still showing the fight and energy, but your body unable to keep up with the pace. You suffered for someone so active, so determined to be out of the house whenever you could. You made random, silly excuses to leave the house; you’d tell Nanima you needed to get the mail (downstairs) and disappear for a half hour because everyone told you you shouldn’t be out as much.</p>
<p>You loved technology and new things. You were one of the few people who sat on a computer everyday, sending out emails and newsletters of things you read. You may not have been able to in the last couple of years, but I still remember and have the links you sent me to read.</p>
<p>I remember last year when you were in a little better health, and I sat with you, you asked me what I did. The answer I gave you — as I give most people alien to IT — did not satisfy you and you asked for more. The curiosity didn’t leave your face until I explained in detail how we look after servers, how we deal with customers, what I did specifically in my role and how we handled issues if they arose with customers.</p>
<p>You were the most active man I have ever met, in yours, my parents’ and my own generation; an example of a human being.</p>
<p>I miss you already. I’m glad you had your children and some of their children around you these last few weeks. And I am glad you are no longer in pain.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/12/03/with-a-heavy.html">With a heavy heart, life after @Posterous</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I’ve been a <a href="http://www.posterous.com/" target="_blank">Posterous</a> advocate for some time now and my loyalty to the platform only grew the more I used it. It wasn’t without its problems (themes, for a start), but when it came to posting &amp; sharing, Posterous stood out on platform and features. I ran four different blogs on Posterous — what-was-this-blog, food, corporate and more recently, a collection of pictures — and converted a few people to it as well.</p>
<p>Something I’m yet to see in any other platform is how well Posterous managed sharing. The ability for group blogs to have posts shared to a group account and people’s personal accounts was pretty solid, not to mention Posterous’ autoposting capabilities. For example, I never once manually uploaded a picture to my Flickr in over two years but I have a full photo history there.</p>
<p>Sadly, their Twitter acquisition has changed all of this.</p>
<p>As Twitter tends to do, they hired the Posterous team for talent, which is great and I’m really happy for the guys too — I’ve followed some of them and know them to be driven individuals <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35196461648/how-we-ran-product-at-posterous-by-agarwal" target="_blank">who care about their products</a>.</p>
<p>But I also know that Posterous will not develop new features for the foreseeable future. This is a problem in and of itself. What’s more, existing things are starting to break (or being intentionally deactivated, I’m not really sure) and there’s no one supporting that.</p>
<p>At first I thought my big question would be where do I go. Oddly enough, that decision didn’t take long, but I learnt that the real question was how.</p>
<p>Wordpress is the only platform that has a Posterous importer that actually works but I had/have no interest in moving there.* I have no inclination to maintain a self-hosted break-fix blog and .com tends to be a little limited with the kind of tweaks I like to have. Plus, my blog is a lot about bits and pieces, thoughts and observations, a link here, a picture there and for that, Tumblr actually does a significantly better job, while managing the environment for me. So this is where I am today.</p>
<p>In fun timing, Tumblr’s <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/36598494153/top-10" target="_blank">recent post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Tumblr has broken into the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/p-19UtqE8ngoZbM" target="_blank">Top 10 sites</a> in the U.S., and now has a worldwide audience of 170 million people.</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve moved my blogs and have started a shutdown of the old. The blog &amp; feed URL will stay in case there are people that do actually read along.</p>
<p>At the rate the migration occurred, I think I will be annoyed enough to write out a post talking about how this was accomplished, because it is in fact turning out to be a rather woeful experience. More on that later.</p>
<p>To Posterous. The platform that was.</p>
<p>Update, 15 Feb 2013: As expected, <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous" target="_blank">Posterous will shut down April 30</a>.</p>
<p>–<br />*For the record, I do think that Wordpress is one of the strongest content/blogging platforms out there, it’s just not for me.</p>

<blockquote>Dubai was founded on trade, not real estate booms. It was founded on entrepeneurialism and what ‘the authorities’ always liked to call a ‘laissez faire’ attitude to free market economics. It was opportunistic. And it will continue to succeed on trade, not selling implausible dreams. Its most successful and enduring assets, Jebel Ali, Emirates, Port Rashid and others, are built on trade. <br /><br />…</blockquote>
<blockquote>The million dollar question is whether we, collectively, have learned our lesson. Whether we can build for the future without being pitched back into the nightmare of the boom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Over the course of my career and journey as an entrepreneur, I have learned that success and fulfillment is found when we push ourselves beyond our comfort zone. There is tremendous value in having knowledge ahead of time — <em>I am now CPR certified</em> — but simply taking action is often what it takes.</blockquote>
