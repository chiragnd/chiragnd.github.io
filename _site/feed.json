Rate-limits should be the same for an app like Icro as they are for the official Micro.blog app, for example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been thinking about blogging and content, and how the breakup of traditional ‘blogs’ have cost us, the netizens, a whole lot.</p>\n\n<p>The more time passes, the more I appreciate the philosophy that sits behind Micro.blog. Every decision won’t be perfect and/or popular, but it is good to see that the driving principles of it all are rooted in the <a href=\"http://www.indieweb.org\">right place</a>. Manton’s been extremely open and communicative about it, so I hope that part scales as this gets bigger. With <a href=\"http://www.chirag.biz/2018/05/16/steve-straza-the.html\">the way Twitter is handling third-party apps that built the platform</a>, the timing is perfect too.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(To be clear, we’d offer this for free. Our business is blog hosting.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m glad to see Micro.blog’s monetary stream is both clear upfront and doesn’t require surrendering user privacy.</p>\n\n",
