Now close your eyes and imagine that instead of a sweet, sugar-rushing sponge cake, you have a savory, slightly spicy, salty delicious sponge cake. Yes I realize you can’t read this if you closed your eyes, but I’m also relying on the fact that no one listens to me anyway.</p>
<p>A Gujarati specialty, Khaman is the equivalent of a savory sponge cake, with just the right amount of spice and flavor, and topped with a tempering of mustard and garnished with coriander and sometimes, grated coconut. Most people have a weakness for this gram-flour deliciousness, considering it can be eaten all by itself, or dipped in the chutney of the day.</p>
<p>I have even managed — wait for it — to make a Khaman sandwich that tasted so awesome, it’s now a standard occurance every time there’s Khaman in the house.</p>
<p>So there you have it, the savory and slightly spicy sponge cake, the Khaman.</p>
