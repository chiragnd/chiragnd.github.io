Fine, say that you have?), you’ll know I’m a sucker for iced tea. So after having iced tea a few times at <a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Whittard of Chelsea</a> at Festival City in Dubai, I finally succumbed and picked up this little wonder.</p>
<p>Ah, Whittard’s iced tea from the comfort of my own home.??</p>
