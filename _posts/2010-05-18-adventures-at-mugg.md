It’s quite unfortunate actually that they’ve shut down their branches anywhere except Abu Dhabi. With a menu that boasts a variety of options for every meal of the day, it is a bit of a wonder why they didn’t exactly take off as a concept.</p>
<p>It also helps that there aren’t too many options in Abu Dhabi, unlike Dubai, where you can stop for a bite or a quick drink and also be able to work. Although for the size of the place, having exactly 2 power outlets is quite a negative point (no pun intended). If you aren’t lucky, you’re stuck without one, which is useless if like me, your laptop battery doesn’t have much of a life. Surely they’ve heard of a multiple outlet??<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector" target="_blank">surge protector</a>???</p>
<p>Pictured above is their Egg salad with Spring Onion Mayo sandwich pair. Makes for a nice quick bite to eat midway through the day, even if it is a bit difficult to eat as the bread gets soggier with time and it’s an open sandwich.</p>
<p>Why I’m sold? Well, they have bottomless <a href="http://www.naihar.com/coffee-or-tea-3" target="_blank">iced tea</a>. Precious little beats that in my book, I’m afraid.</p>
