<p>Netflix and HBO are slowly but surely changing a lot about the way we consume TV. <a href="https://medium.com/@rexsorgatz" title="Go to the profile of Rex Sorgatz" target="_blank">Rex Sorgatz</a> actually makes an interesting point in <a href="https://medium.com/message/how-netflix-broke-the-unbreakable-spoiler-alert-f0215bf930cf" target="_blank">How Netflix the spoiler alert and how to fix it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In attempting to fix an outdated system (the weekly release calendar), technology has created a new problem (silencing discussion). But surely, we can solve this dilemma.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the premise, and the fact that binge watching has changed the way we talk about TV. Rex’s proposal is a modest mid-way between what it was, and what it is becoming, but I don’t believe it works for ‘all’ TV.</p>
<p>However, this made me think about something else.</p>
<p>As someone who lives in a country where ‘Sorry, but this content is not available in your geographical location’ is a constant let down, I think content providers will do better to fix <em>this</em> problem. The movie industry seems to be able to put out movies around the globe, and people are willing to pay multiple times a month, to watch them. It probably helps that there aren’t content providers sitting in between.</p>
<p>The world is too ubiquitous today for this to still be a problem. Particularly for things like TV previews, and interviews with stars. Finding a consistent way to deliver TV content across the globe, inside a simple subscription model, is where the disruption probably is.</p>
