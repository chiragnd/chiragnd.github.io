<p>Life is no longer just a yes or a no. Almost always, the answer is ‘it depends.’</p>
<p>What I do for a living involves technological babble, nerd speak. But it still doesn’t mean I know everything about your situation to provide you a consult. That’s why more often that not it’s ‘it depends’. This is the right approach for your IT environment provided a, b &amp; c. Based on x, y &amp; z, you should do this. It depends.</p>
<p>The same happens with food. Two different people asking me for a recommendation for a place to eat out will be often given two different responses, even if the cuisine is the same. Some people relate to my experience better; others prefer things that are different from me. Again, it depends.</p>
<p>We live in a world of many, many choices. Technology, politics, food, life.</p>
<p>To the world at large: stop expecting finite answers, and stop outraging over opposing answers. What works for you, won’t always work for everyone else, and vice-versa. It’s okay. Really, it is. Take a deep breath. It will be okay.</p>
