<strong>The Nutcracker, Mumbai: 4 </strong>/ 5<br>Cuisine: Casual, Cafe (All vegetarian, they serve eggs)</blockquote>
<p>It’s hot and humid. You’re trekking down an alleyway, following the advice of a must-visit place where ‘everything on the menu is delicious’. And you’re dying for a salad after a week long gluttony that comes with travel.</p>
<p>As you perspire your way to the door, you’re greeted with a quaint, bustling, cozy little cafe that has extra stools hanging upside down on the walls. Interesting.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>The Nutcracker </em>itself, a table seems almost hard to find at lunchtime, and there’s little room to wait. Thankfully this phase of our journey only lasts about 10 minutes and we’re ushered to a table. As the waiter eventually comes up to us, I order the Asian salad and I put forth my eternal drink question: “Is your iced tea made in-house?” With the answer in the affirmative, we can proceed.</p>

These crispy bits of heaven remind me of <a href="https://youtu.be/F-VsLRVemzk?t=2m13s" target="_blank">Heston Blumenthal’s triple cooked chips</a>, such is their perfection. And yet I’m blown away most by a condiment—the fresh wholegrain mustard. Such is Nutcracker’s attention to detail that even this — this delicious, lick it off your fingers mustard — is stellar.</p>

The tofu grilled vegetable salad is equally good, but the tanginess and zing of the Asian salad makes it our favorite of the meal, at par with 5-star versions of this dish.</p>
<p>As we slowly cool down and settle, it’s time to leave. But not before the 3 people almost breathing down our necks have started where our experience began, ready to take over our table.</p>
<p>I hear the burgers are pretty good too.</p>
