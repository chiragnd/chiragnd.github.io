<p>Consider the premise for a new TV show on one of the many, many channels:</p>
<p>A family has 3 adult sons. The father of the household (traditionally the head of the family) has decided that he wants a specific girl to be his daughter-in-law. So now, he will spend the rest of the TV show’s life (and what’s left of Indian households’ brains) deciding which of his sons she will marry.</p>
<p>Are. You. Kidding.</p>
