<figure><img alt="Tres" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/0e258819ec.jpg"></figure><p>On a lazy Friday afternoon, post lunch, what’s that one piece of food that can completely satisfy all your senses? Well most of us have a vague idea of what pleases us, after a coma-inducing meal, however for me it has, is and will always be the Tres Leches cake.</p>
<p>Tres Leches, which literally means ‘three milks’ in Spanish, is a light sponge, generously soaked in three different kinds of cow’s milk, baked to perfection ensuring no crust, dense yet light fluffy texture, with every bite screaming ‘just died and gone to heaven’.</p>
<p>If I’ve managed to make you salivate, you can definitely sink your teeth into this cake at Maria Bonita’s Taco shop on Umm Al Sheif road in Jumeirah.</p>
<p>A tip — to avoid disappointment, ring in advance and book a slice for yourself (I know :)).</p>
