<p>I received this email finally on the personal email I rarely give out, after receiving a couple on my more spam-collector email, so someone definitely sold my email address somewhere.</p>
<p>I obviously removed the company’s name..but I mean…what the hey?</p>
<blockquote>We all know the importance of a Will and why we need one. But, sometimes it always seems to get pushed to the back of the queue. There’s always something that appears more important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But there isn’t really. A Will is essential. For everyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Just consider these two points: If you don’t have a Will, you lose control over who will inherit your assets. That is not good. If you don’t have a Will and you are a parent of young children, you will lose control over who looks after them after you’ve gone. That is even worse…</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here at [XYZ], we provide an individual and highly personal service in the area of Will writing. Your Will would be drawn up by an experienced UK family solicitor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Everything is tailored to your individual and specific requirements. We will help you create a Will to suit you and your family. We do not produce a computer template Will, with just the name changed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We also provide a whole range of additional related benefits too. For example, we have vast experience in estate planning, financial protection and investments — and these could be discussed at the same time, if you wish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another advantage to you, are our highly competitive costs. For the production of a bespoke Will (written by human hand), our charges are significantly lower than all of our competitors in the market.</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, if you don’t have a will, why not do something about it TODAY? It could be the most important decision you ever make. We can offer you an unrivalled range of attractive benefits, including:</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A friendly, personal and individual Will writing service</li>
<li>Your Will drawn up by an experienced UK Solicitor</li>
<li>Additional services can include estate planning, financial protection and investments</li>
<li>Comprehensive knowledge of Local UAE Law</li>

<blockquote>To take the first step is simple. Just email us at [XYZ].</blockquote>
<blockquote>We look forward to hearing from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>With warm regards<br><br>Linda</blockquote>
<p>Yeah…no.</p>
