<blockquote>The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence awarded to four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case by a Delhi fast-track court in 2013 and subsequently the Delhi High Court in 2014, rejecting the appeal filed by the convicts.</blockquote>
<p>That we have to cheer that at 4 years and 4 months, this was a ‘fast track’ trial resolution is not a great testament of our due process.</p>
<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyoti Singh, the 23-year-old victim, lost her life on 29 Dec 2012 after immense suffering. Nothing can bring that back.</li>
<li>The accused were given the death penalty as far back as September 2013. The High Court (in March 2014) &amp; The Supreme Court rejected the appeals and upheld the death sentences.</li>
<li>The main accused – who inserted a rusted iron rod into the victim, and gutted her intestines – was judged as a juvenile, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nirbhaya-juvenile-to-walk-free-on-Dec-20-Centre-opposes-move/articleshow/50179656.cms" target="_blank">released in December 2015 and given a grant of Rs. 10,000 and a sewing machine</a>. He <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PTI_News/status/860521590806781952" target="_blank">currently lives under an assumed name</a>.</li>
<li>The Juvenile Justice Act has since been amended in 2015 such that the age to try juveniles as adults if they commit heinous crimes was lowered to 16.</li>
</ul>
