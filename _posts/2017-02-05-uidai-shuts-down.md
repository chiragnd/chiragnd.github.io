<p>The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has shut down 12 websites and 12 mobile applications, while directing closure of 26 additional websites and applications for unauthorized Aadhar-related services including downloading Aadhar card to residents, while illegally collecting Aadhaar number from residents.</p>
<p>The closure is allowed under Section 38, Chapter VII of the Aadhaar Act, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>“punishment … for Whoever, not being authorized by the Authority, intentinoally accesses or secures, downloads, copies or extracts any data from the Central Identities Data Repository, or stored in any removable storage medium…”</blockquote>
<p>The names of the sites have not been disclosed thus far.</p>
<p>The UIDAI also suggests that any person losing his Aadhaar card should download an e-card from UIDAI’s official website, or visit authorized Common Service Centres or Aadhaar’s Permanent Enrollment Centers.</p>
