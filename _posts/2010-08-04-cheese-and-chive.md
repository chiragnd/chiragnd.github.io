I like experimenting in the kitchen, this is the first time I have tried making a savoury muffin, and I must say they were delicious. I used a recipe my mother uses, and it wasn’t too hard to follow.</p>
<p>ingredients:<br>1 egg<br>&amp;frac34; cup water<br>1 cup self-raising flour<br>&amp;frac12; tsp salt<br>125g grated cheddar<br>1 tbsp fresh chives<br>&amp;frac12; tsp pepper<br>coarse sea salt (optional)</p>
<p>method:<br>mix all ingredients together until just combined.<br>Spoon into muffin cases and sprinkle with sea salt.<br>Bake at 190 degrees F for 15 minutes.</p>
