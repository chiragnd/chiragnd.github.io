<p>So here’s how Microsoft defines humor. I particularly enjoyed noticing the list of Recommended Readings. All Google needs to do is setup a similar definition and the world will be a better place.</p>
<p>What? Can’t take a joke?</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<blockquote>Has a positive and constructive sense of humor. Can laugh at himself/herself and with others. Is appropriately funny and can use humor to ease tension.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…</blockquote>
<blockquote>To improve your proficiency, ask yourself the following questions on a regular basis:</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In a seemingly serious situation, what nuggets of humor or irony can I find?</li>
<li>When faced with a potentially difficult situation, is there a way that humor could help? Could lead to a better outcome?</li>
<li>Am I funnier than I think I am? Less funny? Who will give me an honest assessment of my sense of humor?</li>
<li>Could I start my next meeting, presentation, or conversation by telling a funny story?</li>
<li>What are the humorous situations in my life that have taught me something?</li>
</ul>
