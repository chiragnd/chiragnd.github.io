<p>For people I’m close to, I’ve always tried to do something special on their birthday. Generally, this involves getting them something they’ve expressed desire for in the past. It’s always a pleasure looking at their expression for something I managed to remember :)</p>

<p>Sometimes birthdays feel like a grand celebration. Other times, they feel like just another date. The reason for this message is just to say, that no matter what happens in the world, everyone should get at least one wish on their birthday. So here’s a quick shoutout to anyone having a birthday, whether or not it’s a grand celebration, or just a quiet evening. You are worth it.</p>
