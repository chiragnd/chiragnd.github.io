<p>Yes, I totally did not notice the date. However, it must be salvaged, and salvaged now. *Kicks things into execution* Sorry, but you can’t say no.</p>
<p>The last two months have been nothing short of crazy. And not the good kind.</p>
<p>But this is me, starting over, trying to pull it all together. Vowing, over and over again, that next time it will be better.</p>
<p>I feel like a broken record.</p>
