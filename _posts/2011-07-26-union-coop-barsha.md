<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>I had to really think about this one. I finally decided to file it under #funny.</p>
<blockquote>Bachelors have been barred from entering a newly- inaugurated shopping centre in Dubai for fear that they would misuse the massive discounts on offer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We found out that many of them were buying our products on offer only to resell them in at their stores at the original price. So we have decided to turn away single men from entering the hypermarket until the promotion ends,” he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Only men accompanied by a woman are being allowed into the store.</blockquote>
<p>Because that totally solves the problem.</p>
