<p>So LinkedIn <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/29/sharing-on-linkedin-twitter/" target="_blank">ends their twitter sync partnership</a>. Or, technically, I suppose Twitter ends their LinkedIn partnership. Either way though, I’m kind of relieved. No, really, logging into LinkedIn to see a clone of my twitter feed was a little annoying, especially since I knew I was losing out on pure Linkedin content.</p>
<p>That said, I’m wondering if this will become a downward slide for Twitter and its content/developer partnerships. Reading <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience" target="_blank">their blogpost</a>, they mention recently enforcing their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms" target="_blank">developer rules</a>, which contains clauses like developers shouldn’t deliver a similar experience to what twitter is already providing. While the intention may be right — it would theoretically push developers to get creative about creating twitter clients — it would also start causing problems for businesses who sole product is a Twitter client which mimics the Twitter experience but does it much better (and typically with much needed features).</p>
<p>One of my favorites — no, wait — my favorite iPhone twitter client is <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a>. It’s a smooth experience, with my <a href="http://eye.chirag.biz/ooh-helvetica-love-my-day-is-complete" target="_blank">favorite font</a> and awesome previews and conversation views available. But based on the rules, Twitter could say they are delivering a similar experience — with a feed for your Twitter activity, despite the fact that Twitter’s own client is a lot worse (being forced to use Twitter’s RT method is not the only problem I have with it).</p>
<p>But I’m digressing. The point is that Twitter — in a fairly decent move on some level to protect their brand and experience — might start alienating developers and other networks if they keep this up. I’m sure LinkedIn was not pleased.</p>
